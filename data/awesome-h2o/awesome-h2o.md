## Overview
Awesome H2O is a curated, community-driven list of projects, applications, research, tutorials, courses, and books built using H2O, an open-source distributed machine learning platform. The list aggregates learning resources and real-world implementations from the broader H2O user community.

## Features
- **Curated community list**
  - Collects notable H2O-based projects, applications, and research efforts.
  - Focuses on content created by the wider H2O user community rather than official vendor materials.

- **Coverage of H2O use cases and implementations**
  - Includes examples and projects built on H2O’s distributed machine learning capabilities.
  - Highlights both supervised and unsupervised learning use cases.

- **Learning resources**
  - Links to community-created tutorials and how-to guides for H2O.
  - References to courses and books that teach or apply H2O.

- **Research and academic material**
  - Includes research papers and academic projects that utilize H2O.

- **Ecosystem and tooling references**
  - Surfaces extensions, tools, and integrations built around H2O.

- **Contribution-friendly repository**
  - Public GitHub repository with contribution guidelines (`contributing.md`).
  - Open to pull requests to expand or refine the list.
  - Includes a code of conduct (`code-of-conduct.md`) to guide community interactions.

- **Context around H2O platform capabilities**
  - References that H2O supports parallelized implementations of many algorithms, including:
    - Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
    - Gradient Boosting Machines (including XGBoost)
    - Random Forests
    - Deep Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
    - Stacked Ensembles
    - Naive Bayes
    - Cox Proportional Hazards
    - K-means
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Word2Vec
    - Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)

## Content Source Highlights
- Draws from the broader H2O ecosystem, including:
  - Community projects using the core H2O-3 platform.
  - Community-authored educational material (tutorials, presentations, etc.).
- Complements, but is distinct from, official H2O.ai resources such as:
  - H2O tutorials
  - Blog posts
  - Presentations and meetup materials
  - Videos

## Pricing
- Not applicable. Awesome H2O is an open GitHub-based curated list and is freely accessible.
