## Overview
Awesome Question Answering is a curated, open-source directory of resources related to automated question answering (QA) in natural language. It focuses on QA as a subfield of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), emphasizing machine learning and deep learning approaches. The content is presented in multiple languages (English, Korean, Chinese).

## Features
- **Curated QA Resource List**
  - Organized collection of links and references centered on Question Answering systems and research.
  - Covers QA as a discipline in information retrieval and NLP.
  - Emphasis on machine learning and deep learning–based QA methods.

- **Structured Contents Section**
  - Table-of-contents style navigation to different QA-related topics.
  - Sections for trends, models, datasets, systems, and competitions.

- **Recent Trends in QA**
  - **Recent QA Models**: Highlights or catalogs newly proposed QA architectures and approaches.
  - **Recent Language Models**: Focus on language models relevant to QA (e.g., large language models and other NLP backbones).
  - Subsections for major conferences and publication venues:
    - **AAAI 2020**
    - **ACL 2019**
    - **EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019**
    - **Arxiv** (recent QA-related preprints and papers)
  - **Dataset** subsection under trends, indicating tracked or listed QA datasets.

- **About QA**
  - Conceptual overview of what Question Answering is.
  - **Types of QA**: High-level taxonomy of different QA task types.
  - **Subtypes of QA**: Further breakdown of QA variants (e.g., likely covering reading comprehension, open-domain QA, etc., though not explicitly listed in the snippet).
  - **Analysis and Parsing for Pre-processing in QA Systems**:
    - Discussion of language analysis required for QA pipelines.
  - **Typical QA System Architecture**:
    - Description of how most QA systems have roughly three parts (e.g., likely information retrieval, reasoning/understanding, and answer generation or selection).

- **Events**
  - Section dedicated to QA-related events (e.g., workshops, shared tasks, or conferences). Specific items are not shown in the snippet but the structure indicates listings.

- **Systems**
  - Section presumably listing implemented QA systems, frameworks, or reference implementations.

- **Competitions in QA**
  - Tabular overview of QA benchmarks and competitions, including:
    - **Dataset name and link** (e.g., Story Cloze Test, MS MARCO, MS MARCO V2, SQuAD, SQuAD 2.0).
    - **Language** (e.g., English).
    - **Organizer** (e.g., Univ. of Rochester, Microsoft, Univ. of Stanford).
    - **Since** (year started, e.g., 2016, 2018).
    - **Top Rank / Leading Team** (e.g., msap, YUANFUDAO research NLP, XLNet Team, PINGAN Omni-Sinitic).
    - **Model** (e.g., Logistic regression, MARS, Masque Q&A Style, XLNet single model, ALBERT + DAAF + Verifier ensemble).
    - **Status** (e.g., Closed, Opened).
    - **Over Human Performance** indicator (e.g., `o`/`x` denoting whether systems surpass human performance on that benchmark).

- **Repository Structure & Community Files**
  - **README.md** with the main awesome list content and structure.
  - **LICENSE** file specifying usage and distribution terms.
  - **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** outlining community behavior expectations for contributors.
  - **contributing.md** describing how to propose additions or changes to the list.
  - **images** directory for visual assets used in the documentation.
  - **mds** directory, likely containing additional markdown files for sub-pages or sections.

- **Multilingual Introductory Descriptions**
  - Brief descriptions of the QA domain and the purpose of the list in:
    - English
    - Korean
    - Chinese

## Use Cases
- Discovering QA datasets, benchmarks, and competitions for research or development.
- Finding recent QA and language models relevant to building QA systems.
- Understanding the taxonomy and architecture of QA systems.
- Exploring events and systems in the QA ecosystem.
- Using as a reference hub when starting or expanding QA-related research or projects.

## Licensing
- The repository includes a LICENSE file specifying the license for the awesome list contents (exact license text is in the repo’s `LICENSE` file).

## Pricing
- Not applicable. This is an open-source, curated directory (awesome list) with no pricing plans indicated.
