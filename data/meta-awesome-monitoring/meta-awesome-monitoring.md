## Overview
meta-awesome – Monitoring is a curated meta-category that indexes “awesome” lists and resources focused on monitoring, observability, and related tooling. It serves as a directory that points to multiple specialized lists rather than being a single list of tools itself.

## Features

  - Aggregates multiple “awesome” lists dedicated to monitoring and observability.
  - Helps users discover community-maintained collections of tools and articles.

- **Focus on monitoring & observability**  
  - Targets topics such as infrastructure monitoring, application monitoring, metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and alerting (as covered by the linked awesome lists).

- **GitHub-based directory**  
  - Hosted as part of the `jepemo/meta-awesome` repository.  
  - Uses a markdown document (`monitoring.md`) to organize and link out to external lists.

- **Community-driven content**  
  - Built on top of public GitHub “awesome” lists, reflecting community-contributed knowledge and tooling.

- **Part of a broader meta-awesome collection**  
  - Monitoring is one category within a larger “meta-awesome” project that indexes awesome lists across various domains.
