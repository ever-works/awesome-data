  ## Features

  - **Curated, themed directory** of climate- and environment-focused resources
  spanning many sectors (individual lifestyle, technology, finance, policy,
  media, etc.).

  - **Action-oriented entries**: emphasizes things users can do or use
  (services, products, platforms, and practical ideas) rather than purely
  theoretical information.

  - **Coverage of both systemic and personal action**, from policy and
  philanthropy to individual consumption and behavior change.

  - **Inclusion of commercial and nonprofit offerings**, such as:
    - Membership and donation programs (e.g., giving a percentage of income to environmental nonprofits).
    - Carbon removal and offset services.
    - Crowdfunded cleantech support tools.
    - Data dashboards and trackers for carbon pricing and national climate performance.
  - **Global scope**, referencing international projects, dashboards, and
  organizations.

  - **Open, GitHub-hosted format**, making it easy for the community to
  discover, reference, and potentially contribute.

  ## Pricing

  Awesome Earth itself is a **free, open directory**. Some linked services and
  products listed within the directory have their own pricing or subscription
  models, but those are external to the list and managed by their respective
  providers.
