  # Awesome Game Production

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** games, production, design


  ## Overview

  Awesome Game Production is a curated, open-source directory of resources
  focused on the game production process. It collects books, articles, tools,
  project management materials, and methodologies to support people working in
  the game producer role.


  The list centers on video game production as a process (from solo developers
  to teams) and specifically targets the responsibilities of game producers who
  manage and orchestrate development. It intentionally does not cover individual
  specialist disciplines such as game design, programming, or QA, and instead
  complements those via the broader "Awesome" ecosystem.


  ## Features

  - **Curated resource collection**
    - Focused on the end-to-end game production process.
    - Includes books, articles, tools, project management resources, and methodologies.

  - **Producer-centric scope**
    - Emphasis on the video game producer role: planning, coordination, and management of development.
    - Oriented toward practical use in real production environments.
    - Distinct from discipline-specific areas like design, programming, and QA (those are covered elsewhere in the "Awesome" lists).

  - **Multiple content formats**
    - Books section for in-depth learning.
    - Articles section (mentioned) for more practical, applied guidance.
    - Likely additional sections (implied by description) such as tools and project management references.

  - **Open contribution model**
    - Public GitHub repository with a `contributing.md` guide for adding new resources.
    - Encourages community contributions via pull requests.
    - Includes a `code-of-conduct.md` to support a respectful, collaborative environment.

  - **Part of the Awesome ecosystem**
    - Listed as an "Awesome"-style repository, following the recognizable Awesome list format.
    - Complements the main Awesome list’s Gaming section for broader game development topics.

  - **Repository structure & governance**
    - Separate folders (e.g., `media`) and markdown files (`readme.md`, `license`, `code-of-conduct.md`, `contributing.md`) for clarity and maintainability.
    - Licensed for open use and contribution (license file present).

  ## Pricing
