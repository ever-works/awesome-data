  ### Description
  Meta Awesome – Miscellaneous Resources is a curated index of assorted “awesome” lists and complementary resources that fall outside the main Meta Awesome categories. It aggregates links to additional topic-specific lists, tools, and reference materials to extend the broader Meta Awesome collection.

  ### Features
  - **Curated index of miscellaneous resources**
    - Focuses on awesome lists and resources that do not neatly fit into primary Meta Awesome categories.
    - Complements the core Meta Awesome documents by covering edge cases and niche topics.

  - **Part of the Meta Awesome ecosystem**
    - Lives within the `jepemo/meta-awesome` GitHub repository.
    - Structured as a single markdown document (`miscellaneous-resources.md`) for easy browsing and contribution.

  - **GitHub-based organization**
    - Hosted on GitHub, benefiting from version control, issue tracking, and community contributions.
    - Links out to external resources (primarily other GitHub repositories and documentation pages).

  - **Extensible directory structure**
    - Can be updated with new miscellaneous lists and resources over time.
    - Designed to serve as a catch-all index for useful but uncategorized materials.

  ### Notable Linked Resource Types

  - AI and developer tooling (e.g., AI-assisted coding, code management, prompt and model tooling).
  - Developer workflows (automation, cloud dev environments, issue tracking, code review).
  - Application and code security (vulnerability detection, code security, secret management).
  - Topical exploration (AI, software development, DevOps, security, and related articles).
