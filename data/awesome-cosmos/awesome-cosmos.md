## Overview
Awesome Cosmos is a community‑curated “awesome list” of projects, tools, libraries, and resources across the Cosmos ecosystem. It focuses on the Cosmos SDK and related technologies for building app-specific blockchains in Go.

## Features

### Scope
- Curated directory of Cosmos-related projects and resources
- Focus on building blockchain applications with the Cosmos SDK (in Go)
- Includes both core protocol components and broader ecosystem tools
- Community-maintained with public contribution guidelines

### Core Components
Links to major building blocks in the Cosmos stack:
- **Cosmos Hub (Gaia)** – Reference implementation of the Cosmos Hub
- **Cosmos SDK** – Modular framework for building Cosmos-based blockchains in Go
- **IBC Go** – Inter-Blockchain Communication implementation for Cosmos SDK chains
- **CometBFT** – Consensus and networking engine (Tendermint successor)
- **CosmWasm** – Smart contract platform for the Cosmos ecosystem
- **CosmJS** – JavaScript/TypeScript library suite for interacting with Cosmos chains
- **Protobuf (Buf, Cosmos packages)** – Protocol buffer definitions and tooling
- **IAVL** – Immutable AVL tree implementation used for state storage in Cosmos SDK
- **ICS23** – Specification and implementation for commitment proofs

### Documentation Resources
Centralized links to official and ecosystem documentation:
- **Cosmos Developer Portal** – Tutorials and guides for Cosmos development
- **Interchain Developer Academy** – Structured educational material for interchain devs
- **Cosmos SDK Docs** – Official documentation for the SDK
- **IBC Docs** – Documentation for Inter-Blockchain Communication
- **CometBFT Docs** – Documentation for the consensus engine
- **Cosmos Hub Docs** – Information and docs for the Cosmos Hub
- **CosmWasm Docs** – Smart contract development documentation
- **Cosmology Learn** – Educational content and guides from Cosmology

### Client Libraries
Organized by language for application and tooling development.

#### Go
- **Ignite CLI** – Tooling to scaffold and manage Cosmos SDK blockchains:
  - Bootstraps new Cosmos SDK chains
  - Provides UI support
  - Supports creating and working with Cosmos SDK modules

#### JavaScript / TypeScript
- **cosmos/cosmjs** – Core JavaScript/TypeScript library for Cosmos interactions
- **telescope** – TypeScript library generator built on top of CosmJS
- **chainapsis/cosmosjs** – Signing and API library from Chainapsis
- **cosmos-client/cosmos-client-ts** – JS/TS client for Cosmos SDK blockchains
- **cosmology-tech/chain-registry** – npm package exposing the official Cosmos chain registry
- **strangelove-ventures/graz** – (partially listed; React/TS tooling for Cosmos wallets and dApps, per ecosystem context)

### Additional Sections (Structure)
The list also organizes resources under many additional section headings (items not fully shown in provided content but indicated by the table of contents):
- **Block Explorers** (visual and terminal)
- **Chain Registry**
- **Validators**
- **Cosmos SDK Modules**
- **Monitoring**
- **Indexers**
- **Frameworks**
- **Virtual Machines**
- **IBC**
- **Testing**
- **Templates**
- **Tools** (CLI, GUI, bots)
- **Node Operations** (and utilities)
- **Ecosystem**
- **Wallets**
- **Blogs & Articles**
- **Related** resources

These headings indicate that the repository is designed as a broad entry point into most categories of Cosmos development and operations tooling.

### Community & Governance
- Open contribution model via a public **Contributing guide**
- Acknowledgment of community **contributors**
- Explicit **disclaimer** that the list is community-maintained and not an official statement from any entity
