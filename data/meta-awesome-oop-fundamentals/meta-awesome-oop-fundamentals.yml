  ## Overview

  meta-awesome – OOP Fundamentals is a curated meta-directory that aggregates
  “awesome lists” and learning materials focused on core object-oriented
  programming (OOP) principles. It serves as a central index linking to external
  resources that explain and teach foundational OOP concepts.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-directory of OOP resources** – Collects and organizes links to
  multiple “awesome” style lists and other curated resources about OOP
  fundamentals.

  - **Focus on core OOP principles** – Targets foundational concepts such as
  (based on the description and typical OOP coverage):
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Abstraction
    - General object-oriented design and thinking
  - **Learning-oriented content** – Emphasizes learning materials to help users
  understand OOP from first principles (e.g., tutorials, conceptual articles,
  guides, and reference lists).

  - **GitHub-hosted directory** – Implemented as a Markdown document in a GitHub
  repository, making it easy to browse, clone, or contribute through standard
  GitHub workflows.

  - **Subpage of a broader meta-awesome project** – Part of the wider
  `meta-awesome` collection, which aggregates themed awesome lists; this page
  specifically concentrates on OOP fundamentals.


  ## Pricing

  to be free to access based on the available information.
