  # Awesome Cheminformatics


  **URL:** https://github.com/hsiaoyi0504/awesome-cheminformatics#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** biology, scientific-computing, data-science  

  **Type:** Curated directory / Awesome list


  ## Overview

  Awesome Cheminformatics is a curated, open directory of cheminformatics
  software, libraries, and learning resources focused on applying computational
  and data-driven methods to chemistry problems. It primarily highlights
  command-line and free/open‑source tools.


  ## Features


  ### Scope and Focus

  - Curated list dedicated to cheminformatics (chemoinformatics / chemical
  informatics).

  - Emphasis on tools and resources for applying computational and informational
  techniques to chemistry tasks.

  - Focus on command-line, free, and open‑source software where possible.


  ### Applications

  - **Visualization**
    - Collection of tools for visualizing chemical structures, molecules, and related data.
  - **Command Line Tools**
    - Command-line utilities for cheminformatics workflows (e.g., structure processing, conversions, batch analyses).
  - **Docking**
    - Software for molecular docking and structure-based virtual screening.
  - **Virtual Machine**
    - Virtual machine or preconfigured environments to run cheminformatics toolchains.

  ### Libraries

  - **General Purpose**
    - Programming libraries covering broad cheminformatics functionality (e.g., molecule representations, I/O, computation).
  - **Format Checking**
    - Tools and libraries for validating and checking chemical file formats.
  - **Visualization Libraries**
    - Libraries for rendering chemical structures, 2D/3D molecular graphics, and interactive views.
  - **Molecular Descriptors**
    - Libraries to compute chemical descriptors and features for molecules.
  - **Machine Learning**
    - Toolkits and libraries that connect cheminformatics data with machine learning workflows.
  - **Web APIs**
