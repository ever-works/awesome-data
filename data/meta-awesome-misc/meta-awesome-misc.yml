  # meta-awesome – Misc


  **Category:** Meta-directories  

  **Slug:** `meta-awesome-misc`  

  **Source:** <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/misc.md>


  ## Overview

  The **meta-awesome – Misc** section is part of the broader *meta-awesome*
  project. It aggregates and organizes miscellaneous "awesome" and curated lists
  that do not fit neatly into other, more specific meta-awesome categories.


  ## Features

  - **Miscellaneous Awesome Lists**
    - Collects assorted awesome lists that fall outside main topical categories.
    - Acts as a catch‑all directory for niche or cross‑category curated lists.

  - **Meta-directory Role**
    - Functions as a meta-directory (a directory of directories/lists).
    - Helps users discover additional awesome lists indirectly related to primary topics.

  - **Curated Content**
    - Focuses on curated lists, emphasizing quality and organization rather than raw link dumps.

  - **Integration with meta-awesome Project**
    - Lives within the `meta-awesome` repository under `doc/misc.md`.
    - Complements other category-specific meta-awesome documents by covering what they omit.
