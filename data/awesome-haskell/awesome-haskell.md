## Overview
Awesome Haskell is a curated, community-driven directory of Haskell resources. It aggregates links to Haskell libraries, frameworks, tools, and software, organized into thematic sections. The list is part of the broader "awesome" collection of curated lists on GitHub.

## Features

### Curated Haskell Ecosystem Directory
- Aggregates links to Haskell libraries, frameworks, and tools.  
- Includes both general-purpose and specialized Haskell software.  
- Part of the wider [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) project line, following its curation conventions.

### Thematic Organization
Resources are grouped into topical sections to make discovery easier. Examples from the content:

#### Algorithmics
Curated links to algorithm- and logic-related Haskell resources, including:
- **Theorem Provers**  
  - Haskell theorem prover resources on the Haskell Wiki.
  - Collaborative Hackage category listing for theorem provers.
- **Algorithm-related categories on Hackage** (collaborative lists):
  - Algorithm  
  - Algorithm Visualization  
  - Algorithms
- **Specialized computational areas** (Hackage collaborative lists):
  - Compression  
  - Formal Languages  
  - Formal Methods  
  - Logic  
  - Logic Programming  
  - MapReduce  
  - Graphs  
  - Optimization  
  - Simulation  
  - SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)  
  - Symbolic Computation

#### Audio, Music & Sound
Links to Haskell libraries and resources for audio and music:
- **Audio, music and sound** section on the Haskell Wiki (applications and libraries).  
- **Audio** Hackage category (collaborative list).  
- **Codec** and related packages (via Hackage categories; partially visible in the provided content).

### Integration with Official and Community Resources
- Links to **Haskell Wiki** sections (e.g., Theorem Provers, Music and Sound) as “official website resources.”
- Links directly into **Hackage** category pages, leveraging Hackage’s collaborative package lists.

### GitHub-Based List
- Hosted as a GitHub repository (`krispo/awesome-haskell`).  
- Maintains a README-based index of links.  
- Standard awesome-list structure, benefiting from community contributions and version history.

## Pricing
- Awesome Haskell is a free, open, GitHub-hosted curated list. No pricing or paid plans are involved.
