## Overview
Go Books is an open, curated directory of books about the Go programming language. The list is maintained in an “Awesome list” style and brings together both free and paid resources, organized to help learners and practitioners at different skill levels.

## Features
- **Curated Go-focused catalog**
  - Dedicated solely to books about the Go programming language.
  - Emphasis on quality, reputable titles.

- **Awesome-list style organization**
  - Structured as a GitHub-based Awesome list repository.
  - Uses Markdown sections and anchors for easy navigation.

- **Skill-based categorization**
  - **Starter Books**: Introductory and beginner-friendly titles for learning Go fundamentals.
  - **Advanced Books**: Resources for deeper, more specialized, or expert-level topics in Go.
  - **Web Development**: Books focused on using Go in web and backend development contexts.

- **Resource section**
  - Separate **Resources** section for additional learning materials related to Go (e.g., complementary reading, references, or external links beyond core books).

- **Free and paid titles**
  - Includes books explicitly marked as *Free* (e.g., “Learning Go”).
  - Also lists well-known commercial titles like *The Go Programming Language*.

- **Book metadata and links**
  - Each entry includes:
    - Book title and publication year.
    - Link to official site or hosting page.
    - Often authors’ names.
    - In some cases, notes about focus (e.g., concurrency, goroutines, channels, error handling) or level.

- **Open contribution model**
  - Public GitHub repository (`dariubs/GoBooks`) with a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for community contributions.
  - Community-maintained, allowing additions and updates to the book list over time.

- **Quality checks via GitHub Actions**
  - Automated workflow (`links.yml`) to check and maintain link validity.
  - Badges indicating link-check status and inclusion in the broader Awesome lists ecosystem.

## Typical Use Cases
- Finding a starting book to learn Go from scratch.
- Discovering advanced or specialized Go titles (e.g., concurrency, systems programming, web development).
- Identifying free Go books and online texts.
- Browsing a vetted, community-updated list instead of searching ad hoc.

## Pricing
- **Access to the Go Books directory:** Free (open GitHub repository).
- Individual listed books may have their own pricing or be free; pricing is determined by each book’s publisher/author and is not centralized in this directory.
