  ## Overview

  meta-awesome – Other is a general-purpose "catch‑all" section within the
  broader *meta-awesome* project. It collects and organizes links to "awesome"
  lists that don’t fit cleanly into more specific or predefined categories,
  serving as a directory of miscellaneous curated lists.


  ## Features

  - **General-purpose category** for awesome lists that don’t belong in existing
  topical sections.

  - **Part of the meta-awesome ecosystem**, which focuses on directories of
  curated lists.

  - **Directory-of-directories role**, linking out to other awesome-style
  collections rather than hosting all content directly.

  - **Supports miscellaneous topics**, enabling inclusion of niche, emerging, or
  cross‑disciplinary lists.

  - **Curated organization**, helping users discover awesome lists that might
  otherwise be hard to categorize or find.

  - **GitHub-hosted documentation** (via `doc/other.md`), making it accessible
  and version-controlled alongside the rest of the project.


  ## Pricing

  - No pricing information is provided. The resource is hosted as a public
  GitHub documentation page and is typically freely accessible.
