  Curated, community-driven directory of useful Scala libraries, frameworks, and
  tools.

  ## Overview


  Awesome Scala is a curated list of notable Scala libraries, frameworks, and
  related software. It is intended as a starting point for exploring the Scala
  ecosystem rather than a complete catalog. The list is community-maintained and
  inspired by other "Awesome" collections (such as awesome-python).


  It highlights projects from across the Scala ecosystem and visually emphasizes
  repositories with over 500 GitHub stars.

  ## Features


  - **Curated Scala ecosystem list**  
    Community-driven directory of useful Scala libraries, frameworks, and software.

  - **Exploration-focused**  
    Designed as a starting point to discover high-quality Scala projects rather than an exhaustive index.

  - **Project emphasis by popularity**  
    Projects with more than 500 GitHub stars are formatted in bold to make popular options easy to spot.

  - **Thematic organization**  
    Libraries and tools are grouped into topical sections (e.g., Archive and Compression, Artificial Intelligence, and many other categories visible in the table of contents).

  - **GitHub-based listing**  
    Each entry typically includes name, description, and GitHub activity information in tabular form.

  - **Complementary to Scaladex**  
    References and links to Scaladex, a searchable and tagged central index of Scala libraries, for deeper or more systematic searching.

  - **Automated README generation**  
    The main `README.md` is auto-generated from a `template.md` file, ensuring consistent structure and easier maintenance.

  - **Metadata tooling**  
    Includes helper scripts (such as `add-metadata.py`) to manage and update metadata for the list.

  - **Open contribution model**  
    Anyone can propose additions or changes via pull requests or issues, subject to curation guidelines.

  - **Quality and maintenance guidelines**  
    New entries should:
    - Be actively maintained (updated within the last 6 months).
    - Meet a quality bar of being "awesome" (i.e., notable and useful in practice).

  ## Contributing


  - Contributions are accepted via GitHub pull requests or issues.  

  - Contributors should:
    - Add or modify entries in `template.md` (not in `README.md`, which is generated automatically).
    - Avoid submitting unmaintained or low-activity projects (no updates in the last 6 months).

  Refer to the repository’s README and contribution guidelines for the exact
  process and formatting requirements.
