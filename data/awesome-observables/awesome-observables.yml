  # Awesome Observables


  **Description**  

  A curated Awesome list of JavaScript libraries and resources that use the
  Observable pattern. It focuses on tools and materials for working with
  push-based data sources such as events, timer intervals, async requests, and
  animations.

  ## Features

  - Curated collection focused specifically on the Observable pattern in
  JavaScript.

  - Includes libraries that **harness the power of Observables**, even if they
  are **not strictly spec-compatible** Observable implementations.

  - Targets **push-based data sources**, including:
    - DOM and custom events
    - Timer intervals
    - Asynchronous requests (e.g., HTTP, network calls)
    - Animations and time-based UI changes
  - Highlights libraries that allow Observables to be:
    - Transformed (mapping, filtering, etc.)
    - Combined (merging, zipping, composing streams)
    - Consumed using **array-like methods** (e.g., map, filter, reduce style operations).
  - Serves as a developer resource for learning and applying reactive and
  observable patterns in JavaScript projects.
