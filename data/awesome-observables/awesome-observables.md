## Features
- Curated collection focused specifically on the Observable pattern in JavaScript.
- Includes libraries that **harness the power of Observables**, even if they are **not strictly spec-compatible** Observable implementations.
- Targets **push-based data sources**, including:
  - DOM and custom events
  - Timer intervals
  - Asynchronous requests (e.g., HTTP, network calls)
  - Animations and time-based UI changes
- Highlights libraries that allow Observables to be:
  - Transformed (mapping, filtering, etc.)
  - Combined (merging, zipping, composing streams)
  - Consumed using **array-like methods** (e.g., map, filter, reduce style operations).
- Serves as a developer resource for learning and applying reactive and observable patterns in JavaScript projects.
