## Overview

Awesome Browserify is a curated, community-maintained list of resources, libraries, and tools for [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify), the JavaScript module bundler that brings Node-style `require()` to the browser.

Browserify analyzes all `require()` calls in your application and bundles the dependency graph into a single file that can be included in the browser via one `<script>` tag.

## Features

### Focus and Scope
- Dedicated solely to the Browserify ecosystem.
- Curates "awesome" quality resources, libraries, and tools.
- Covers both official and community-maintained materials.

### Browserify Concept Coverage
- Explains how to use Node-style `require()` in browser code.
- Describes bundling of npm-installed modules for browser usage.
- Notes that Browserify recursively analyzes `require()` calls to build a dependency bundle.
- Targets delivery of bundles via a single `<script>` tag for the browser.

- **Official Resources**  
  Pointers to official Browserify documentation and authoritative materials.

- **Community Resources**
