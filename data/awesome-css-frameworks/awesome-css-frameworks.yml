  ## Overview

  Awesome CSS Frameworks is a curated, regularly updated list of modern CSS
  frameworks, toolkits, and grids for web UI development. It organizes
  frameworks into clear categories, helping developers quickly find suitable
  options for layout, styling, normalization, and utility-based CSS.


  ## Features

  - **Curated directory of CSS frameworks**
    - Focused specifically on CSS frameworks and related tooling for UI development.
    - Emphasizes active, modern projects (with a separate section for stalled development).

  - **Structured by use-case and style**
    - **Base / Reset / Normalize** – Frameworks and snippets for normalizing or resetting browser defaults and defining base styles (e.g., `modern-normalize`, `ress`, `Natural Selection`).
    - **Class-less** – Frameworks that style semantic HTML without requiring utility or component classes.
    - **Very Lightweight** – Minimalist frameworks focused on small file size and core layout/typography.
    - **General Purpose** – Full-featured frameworks suited for building complete interfaces.
    - **Material Design** – Frameworks implementing or inspired by Google’s Material Design guidelines.
    - **Utility-based** – Frameworks centered around small, composable utility classes.
    - **Specialized** – CSS frameworks aimed at specific niches or UI patterns.
    - **Stalled Development** – Older or no-longer-maintained frameworks clearly separated from actively maintained ones.

  - **Project-level details and links**
    - Each listed framework typically includes:
      - Name and short description.
      - Direct link to its repository and/or homepage.
      - Technology tag (e.g., #CSS).

  - **Contribution-friendly**
    - Public contribution guidelines for adding or updating framework entries.
    - Hosted on GitHub, benefiting from community review and maintenance.

  - **Related resources**
    - Direct pointer to a separate listing of **UI component libraries for React/Vue/Angular**, for users seeking component-level solutions rather than pure CSS frameworks.

  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. This is an open, GitHub-hosted directory (awesome list) and
  is free to access and use.
