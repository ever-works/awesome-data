  ## Description

  Awesome Relay is a curated, community-maintained list of resources, libraries,
  and tools for building data-driven React applications with Facebook’s Relay
  framework and GraphQL. It follows the format and standards of the broader
  “Awesome” lists ecosystem.


  ## Features


  ### Structure & Scope

  - Curated “Awesome” style list focused specifically on the Relay ecosystem.

  - Organized Table of Contents for quick navigation across resource types.

  - Covers both client-side and server-side aspects of building with Relay and
  GraphQL.


  ### Learning Resources

  - **Documentation**: Links to official and key third-party documentation for
  Relay and related tooling.

  - **FAQs**: Frequently asked questions resources to clarify concepts and
  common issues around Relay.

  - **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides and learning materials for getting
  started and building apps with Relay.

  - **Overviews**: High-level articles and talks explaining Relay’s
  architecture, concepts, and best practices.

  - **Example Implementations**: Real-world and sample projects demonstrating
  Relay in practice, including:
    - `relay-chat` – example chat application using Relay.
    - `koa-graphql-relay-example` – Relay with a Koa/GraphQL backend.
    - `koa-graphql` – GraphQL server with Koa.
    - `relay` – core sample or reference implementations.
    - `todomvc-relay-go` – TodoMVC built with Relay and a Go backend.
