- **Legend for course resources**
  - Clear icon/marker legend indicating which resources each course provides:
    - Lecture videos
    - Lecture notes
    - Assignments / labs
    - Readings

- **Example coverage (Systems category)**
  - Courses like UC Berkeley CS 61C (Great Ideas in Computer Architecture / Machine Structures), covering:
    - C and assembly language programming
    - Translation of high-level programs to machine language
    - Computer organization and caches
    - Performance measurement
    - Parallelism
    - CPU design
    - Warehouse-scale computing

- **GitHub-based maintenance**
  - Public repository that can be starred, forked, and contributed to via pull requests.
  - CONTRIBUTING guidelines for community submissions.

## Use Cases

- Self-study across multiple CS disciplines using real university courses.
- Supplementing formal education with additional course materials.
- Discovering structured learning paths in specialized areas (e.g., ML, systems, security).
