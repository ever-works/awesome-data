  ## Overview

  Awesome Position-Based Quantum Cryptography is a curated, community-driven
  list of literature on position-based quantum cryptography (PBQC). It focuses
  on collecting and organizing papers and resources that study how relativistic
  constraints and quantum information can be used to verify location or provide
  cryptographic security.


  Common abbreviations used in the list:

  - **QPV** – Quantum Position Verification  

  - **QPA** – Quantum Position-based Authentication  

  - **PB-QKD** – Position-based Quantum Key Distribution


  ## Features
