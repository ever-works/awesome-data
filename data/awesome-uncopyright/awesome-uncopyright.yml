  # Awesome Uncopyright


  A curated “awesome list” of works and resources related to the public domain,
  with a focus on content free of copyright restrictions or where copyright has
  been intentionally relinquished ("uncopyright").


  - **Website**: https://github.com/johnjago/awesome-uncopyright#readme

  - **Category**: Themed directories

  - **Tags**: awesome-lists, public-domain, culture


  ## Overview


  Awesome Uncopyright is a community-maintained directory of public domain works
  and related projects. It highlights material that is not restricted by
  copyright, either because rights have expired or have been explicitly waived
  by the creators.


  ## Features


  - **Curated public domain directory**  
    A maintained list of works and resources that are in the public domain or effectively unrestricted by copyright.

  - **Topical organization of content**  
    Entries are grouped into clear sections to help users discover specific types of public domain content:
    - **Art** – visual works and art-related public domain collections.
    - **Articles** – written articles about public domain topics or public domain articles themselves.
    - **Blogs** – blogs that focus on or provide public domain content.
    - **Books** – public domain books and collections of freely usable texts.
    - **Essays** – essays in or about the public domain.
    - **Images** – image libraries and resources offering public domain imagery.
    - **Licenses** – information on legal tools and licenses used to place works in the public domain or remove restrictions.
    - **Organizations** – groups and institutions working with or advocating for public domain content.
    - **Related** – other projects and lists connected to public domain or "uncopyright" concepts.
    - **Resources** – reference materials, guides, and educational links about public domain.
    - **Software** – software projects, tools, or code that is in the public domain or similarly unrestricted.
    - **Talks** – recorded talks, lectures, and presentations about public domain, copyright expiration, and uncopyright.
    - **Other** – additional items that don’t fit neatly into the above categories but relate to public domain.

  - **Concept focus: “Uncopyright”**  
    Highlights works where authors have intentionally relinquished their copyright, often using the term *uncopyright* to describe the act of placing their work as freely as possible in the public domain.

  - **Open contribution model**  
    Includes a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file describing how community members can propose additions or improvements to the list via GitHub.

  - **Clear licensing for the list itself**  
    The list’s own content is released under **CC0 1.0** (public domain dedication), meaning the repository’s curated list can itself be reused without copyright restrictions.

  ## Use Cases

  ## Licensing

  dedication)
