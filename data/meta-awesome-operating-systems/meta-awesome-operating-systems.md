## Description
Meta Awesome – Operating Systems is a curated document within the Meta Awesome project that aggregates “awesome lists” dedicated to operating systems, kernels, and OS-level tools. It serves as a meta-directory pointing to multiple specialized lists rather than hosting all content itself.

## Features
- **Meta-aggregation of OS resources**  
  - Collects and links to multiple “awesome” lists focused on operating systems and related technologies.
- **Focus on operating systems and kernels**  
  - Covers OS concepts, implementations, and kernel-level projects through the lists it aggregates.
- **OS-level tools coverage**  
  - Includes lists that focus on utilities, tools, and frameworks operating close to or within the OS layer.
- **Part of the Meta Awesome collection**  
  - Lives under the broader `meta-awesome` repository, which organizes many topic-specific awesome-list aggregations.
- **GitHub-hosted markdown document**  
  - Provided as a markdown file (`operating-systems.md`) within a public GitHub repository, enabling version control, collaboration, and community contributions via pull requests.
- **Structured, link-based index**  
  - Functions primarily as a link index to external curated lists, making it a starting point for deeper exploration into OS topics.

## Pricing
- Not applicable. This is a free, public GitHub document with no stated pricing or plans.
