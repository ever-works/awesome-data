# Context-aware data sets from five domains

## Overview
Context-aware data sets from five domains is a collection of recommendation datasets designed for research in context-aware recommender systems and machine learning. The datasets are distributed with the CARSKit toolkit and are part of a broader listing of public datasets for recommender systems research.

- **Category:** Datasets
- **Provider/Brand:** carskit
- **Use Cases:** Context-aware recommendation research, machine learning experiments, benchmarking recommender algorithms

## Features
- **Context-aware focus:** Specifically designed for studying and evaluating context-aware recommender systems.
- **Multiple domains:** Covers five distinct application domains (exact domains not listed in the provided content, but intended to enable cross-domain comparison and experimentation).
- **Integrated with CARSKit:** Distributed together with the CARSKit context-aware recommendation toolkit, facilitating direct use in experiments with that framework.
- **Public research datasets:** Intended for academic and applied research, and included in an “awesome” curated list of public datasets for recommendation.
- **Machine learning ready:** Structured for use in machine learning workflows, such as training, validation, and testing of recommendation models.
