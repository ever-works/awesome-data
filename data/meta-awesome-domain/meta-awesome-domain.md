## Overview
Meta Awesome – Domain is a curated meta-collection of “awesome” lists specifically related to domains — such as domain-driven design or other domain-focused development topics. It acts as a directory-of-directories, pointing developers to specialized awesome lists instead of hosting the resources directly.

## Features
- **Meta-collection of domain-focused lists**  
  Aggregates multiple “awesome” lists that focus on domains (e.g., domain-driven design or domain-specific development areas).

- **Directory-of-directories structure**  
  Organizes links to other curated lists rather than individual resources, helping users quickly locate the right domain-centric awesome list.

- **GitHub-based index**  
  Hosted as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, search, and contribute via standard GitHub workflows.

- **Thematic organization under “Domain”**  
  Items are grouped around domain-related topics, allowing developers to explore resources that emphasize domain modeling, domain logic, and domain-centric architectures.

- **Part of the broader Meta Awesome project**  
  Integrates into the larger `meta-awesome` ecosystem, which categorizes awesome lists across many themes, with this document specifically covering the “Domain” category.

## Pricing
- Not applicable. This is a free, open GitHub-based directory of links to other public awesome lists.
