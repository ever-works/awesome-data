  ## Overview

  Awesome Data – Image Processing Datasets is a curated, awesome-style directory
  of image processing and computer vision datasets. It is part of the Awesome
  Data (apd-core) project and serves as a meta index to well-known and
  specialized image-focused datasets.


  ## Features

  - **Curated awesome-style list** of image processing and computer vision
  datasets.

  - **Part of the Awesome Data (apd-core) project**, integrating with a broader
  ecosystem of data resource directories.

  - **Focus on image-based datasets**, including:
    - Large-scale classification datasets (e.g., ImageNet).
    - Autonomous driving and scene understanding datasets (e.g., KITTI).
    - Illustration/anime image datasets (e.g., Danbooru).
    - Person re-identification and tracking datasets (e.g., DukeMTMC).
  - **Meta-directory role**: acts as a central index pointing to original
  dataset sources rather than hosting data directly.

  - **Organized under `core/ImageProcessing`** in the APD Core repository for
  structured navigation.

  - **Open GitHub repository**: accessible for browsing, forking, and
  contributions via pull requests.

  - **Consistent formatting with other Awesome-style lists**, making it easy to
  scan and compare datasets.


  ## Use Cases
