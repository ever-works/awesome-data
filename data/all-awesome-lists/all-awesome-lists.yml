  ## Overview

  All Awesome Lists is GitHub’s topic index page for repositories tagged with
  the `awesome` topic. It functions as a central directory of community-curated
  “awesome lists” that catalog high-quality resources across many domains (e.g.,
  programming languages, tools, books, and more).


  An awesome list is a community-curated list of “awesome” things on a specific
  topic. The main reference list of awesome lists is maintained at the
  [`sindresorhus/awesome`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) repository.
