  # Awesome Healthcare


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** health, open-source, software  

  **Source:** https://github.com/kakoni/awesome-healthcare#readme


  ## Overview


  Awesome Healthcare is a curated, community-maintained directory of open source
  healthcare software, libraries, tools, and resources. Every listed project is
  vetted to ensure it is active and provides value for:


  - Healthcare facilities and hospitals

  - Individual healthcare providers

  - Software developers and engineers

  - Policy experts and regulators

  - Researchers and data scientists


  The list is structured as an "Awesome"-style GitHub repository, following the
  sindresorhus/awesome conventions.


  ## Features


  - **Curated, vetted entries**  
    - Each listed project is checked for activity and usefulness.  
    - Focus on software that is meaningfully applicable in real healthcare contexts.

  - **Healthcare-focused scope**  
    - Includes only healthcare-related open source projects, tools, and resources.  
    - Targets clinical, operational, research, and policy use cases.

  - **Category-based organization**  
    The repository organizes projects into multiple topical sections (as visible in the contents structure), including for example:
    - **EHR (Electronic Health Records)** – open source systems and tools dealing with clinical records and workflows.
    - **Specifications** – healthcare data and interoperability specifications, standards, and related tooling.
    - **Prescribing** – tools and systems related to e-prescribing and medication management.
    - **Nursing** – software aimed at nursing workflows and documentation.
    - **Imaging** – imaging-related tools (e.g., PACS, DICOM utilities, viewers, and related libraries).
    - **Dental** – projects focused on dental practice workflows and records.
    - **Laboratory** – laboratory information systems and related utilities (implied by truncated “Laborator...” heading).
    - Additional categories are present in the full README (not fully shown in the truncated content) to cover more healthcare subdomains.

  - **Broad audience coverage**  
    - Useful for clinicians seeking tools to support care delivery.  
    - Helps developers find existing open source components, libraries, and reference implementations.  
    - Supports policy experts and standards bodies by surfacing implementations of key healthcare specifications.  
    - Assists researchers in identifying software that enables data analysis, imaging, EHR integration, and more.

  - **Open source emphasis**  
    - Only open source projects are listed, enabling inspection, modification, extension, and self-hosting where applicable.

  - **Community-driven maintenance**  
    - Hosted on GitHub, allowing contributions via pull requests.  
    - Contribution guidelines and license files are available in the repository.  
    - Issues and pull requests are used to keep the list current and accurate.

  - **Standard Awesome list format**  
    - Follows the style and structure of the broader Awesome ecosystem.  
    - Uses the official Awesome badge and conventions for formatting and curation.

  ## Use Cases


  - Discovering EHR, imaging, prescribing, and laboratory systems for evaluation
  or deployment.

  - Finding reference implementations of healthcare standards and APIs.

  - Identifying libraries and tools to integrate health data into applications.

  - Exploring open source options for clinical, research, or policy projects.


  ## Pricing


  - **Free** – The Awesome Healthcare list itself is freely accessible as a
  public GitHub repository.  
    (Individual projects listed may have their own licenses and usage terms, but the directory is free to browse and use.)
