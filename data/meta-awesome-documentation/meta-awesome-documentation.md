## Overview
Meta Awesome – Documentation is a curated “meta” list that aggregates multiple *awesome* lists focused on documentation. It serves as a directory of directories for resources on technical writing, documentation tools, and best practices, helping users discover specialized documentation-related awesome lists in one place.

## Features
- **Meta index of documentation awesome lists**  
  Aggregates links to many separate awesome lists specifically about documentation.

- **Focus on documentation practices**  
  Highlights lists that cover writing style, structure, workflows, and methodologies for effective documentation.

- **Coverage of documentation tooling**  
  Includes references to lists about tools for authoring, building, publishing, and maintaining docs (e.g., static site generators, doc build systems, linters, etc., as referenced in the underlying lists).

- **Best-practices oriented**  
  Points to resources and lists that emphasize standards, guidelines, and proven approaches to technical documentation.

- **Directory-of-directories structure**  
  Functions as a meta-directory: instead of listing individual tools or articles directly, it primarily links out to other curated awesome lists in the documentation space.

- **Community-driven curation**  
  Hosted on GitHub, allowing community contributions, updates, and improvements via pull requests to keep the meta list current.
