## Description
Meta Awesome – Libraries is an "awesome-style" meta index that aggregates and organizes links to software library collections across many domains. Instead of listing individual libraries, it focuses on curating other library-focused lists, acting as a central directory for discovering libraries in different ecosystems and areas.

## Features
- **Meta index of library lists**
  - Curates links to existing "awesome" and similar lists that focus on software libraries.
  - Serves as an entry point to find libraries across multiple programming languages and domains.

- **Awesome-style organization**
  - Follows the common "awesome list" conventions (Markdown-based, link collections, concise descriptions).
  - Structured to be easily browsable within a single Markdown document.

- **Domain-spanning coverage**
  - Aims to index library collections from various technical areas (e.g., web, data, AI/ML, tooling, etc.).
  - Helps users discover specialized library lists they might not find via a single-language search.

- **Library-focused scope**
  - Emphasis on software libraries rather than general tools, tutorials, or articles.
  - Useful for developers looking specifically for reusable code components.

- **GitHub-hosted, Markdown-based**
  - Maintained as a Markdown file in a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, search, and contribute via pull requests.

## Pricing
- Not a commercial product; it is a public, GitHub-hosted Markdown index available free of charge.
