  ## Features


  - **Curated icon collections**: Focuses on high‑quality, handpicked icon
  projects rather than an exhaustive directory.

  - **Multiple formats**: Lists icon sets available as SVG, PNG, and icon fonts.

  - **Categorized resources** to make discovery easier:
    - **General** – General‑purpose icons suitable for common UI and web usage.
    - **Logos** – Logos of brands, companies, and technologies.
    - **Special** – Icon sets that are neither generic nor logos, but have a special theme or style.
    - **Other**
      - **CSS only** – Icons created purely with CSS (not downloadable assets).
      - **Paid** – Non‑free, not open‑source icon sets that are still considered notable.
  - **Open directory format**: Provided as a GitHub repository/README list for
  easy browsing, cloning, and forking.

  - **Community guidelines**: Includes a code of conduct and contributing guide
  for those who want to propose new icon resources or improvements.

  - **License‑free listing content**: The list itself is released under the CC0
  (public domain) license.

  ## Pricing
