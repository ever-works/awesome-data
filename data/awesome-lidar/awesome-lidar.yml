  # Awesome LIDAR


  **Website:** https://github.com/szenergy/awesome-lidar#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** awesome-lists, GIS, datasets


  ## Overview

  Awesome LIDAR is a curated, community-maintained directory of resources
  related to LIDAR sensors and point cloud data. It aggregates links to
  hardware, datasets, software libraries, frameworks, and simulators used for
  working with LIDAR and point clouds in 2D and 3D.


  LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing method using laser
  light to measure surroundings with approximately centimeter accuracy. The
  resulting data is typically represented as point clouds.


  ## Features

  - **Curated awesome list**
    - Organized collection of LIDAR-related resources following the "awesome list" convention.
    - Focuses on quality and relevance rather than marketing content.

  - **Hardware / Manufacturers**
    - Directory of LIDAR sensor manufacturers.
    - Covers different LIDAR hardware options and vendors.

  - **Datasets**
    - Links to LIDAR and point cloud datasets for research, development, and benchmarking.

  - **Point cloud processing algorithms**
    - References to algorithms and tools for filtering, segmentation, registration, and other point cloud processing tasks.

  - **Point cloud frameworks**
    - Frameworks and libraries for handling, visualizing, and analyzing point clouds.

  - **Simulators**
    - Tools and environments capable of simulating LIDAR sensors and generating synthetic point cloud data.

  - **Ecosystem & tooling indicators**
    - Badges indicating GitHub repositories, YouTube content, and paper references where applicable.
    - Explicit marking of ROS / ROS 2 related resources (e.g., drivers, integrations, packages).

  - **Machine-readable index**
    - `lidar.csv` file containing structured information about listed items (e.g., for programmatic use or further analysis).

  - **Contribution guidelines**
    - `contributing.md` file describing how to propose additions or changes to the list.

  - **Open licensing**
    - Distributed with a `LICENSE` file specifying usage rights for the list content.

  - **Optional alternative view**
    - Mirror/reader view via TrackAwesomeList for easier browsing: `trackawesomelist.com/szenergy/awesome-lidar`.

  ## Intended Use Cases

  - Discovering LIDAR sensor manufacturers and hardware options.

  - Finding publicly available LIDAR/point cloud datasets.

  - Selecting libraries and frameworks for point cloud processing and
  visualization.

  - Identifying ROS/ROS 2 compatible LIDAR tools and drivers.

  - Exploring simulators for testing LIDAR-based perception pipelines.


  ## Pricing

  - This is an open-source, public GitHub repository.  

  - Access and use of the list are free (subject to the repository’s license
  terms).
