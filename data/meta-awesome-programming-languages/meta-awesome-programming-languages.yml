  ## Description
  Meta Awesome – Programming Languages is an "awesome-style" meta collection that indexes other Awesome repositories and curated lists focused on individual programming languages and their ecosystems. It serves as a directory of directories, helping users discover language-specific Awesome lists in one central place.

  ## Features
  - **Meta index of Awesome lists**: Aggregates links to Awesome repositories and curated lists dedicated to specific programming languages.
  - **Language-focused organization**: Entries are grouped around individual programming languages and their broader ecosystems.
  - **Ecosystem coverage**: Includes lists that cover not only the core language but also related tools, libraries, and frameworks.
  - **Standard Awesome style**: Follows the conventions of Awesome lists (curated, link-based collections).
  - **Centralized discovery**: Acts as a single reference point to find multiple language-specific Awesome collections.
  - **Open GitHub document**: Maintained as a markdown document within a public GitHub repository, enabling community viewing and contributions.
  - **Meta-directory role**: Functions as a directory-of-directories, pointing to external curated resources rather than hosting them directly.
