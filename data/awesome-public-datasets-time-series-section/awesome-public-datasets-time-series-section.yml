name: Awesome Public Datasets - Time Series Section
description: A curated set of time series datasets listed in the Awesome Public
  Datasets directory, including realistic and public time-series resources such
  as industrial sensor data, national statistics, hardware failure logs,
  biomedical signals, and academic time-series repositories. This collection
  serves as a meta-directory entry point for practitioners looking for
  high-quality time-series data within the broader Awesome ecosystem.

  # Awesome Public Datasets – Time Series Section


  **Category:** themed-directories  

  **Brand:** awesome-public-datasets  

  **Source:**
  <https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#time-series>


  ## Overview

  The **Time Series** section of the *Awesome Public Datasets* GitHub repository
  is a curated subdirectory of public, realistic time-series datasets. It
  aggregates links to external sources that provide time-indexed data broadly
  useful for data science, research, and applied analytics.


  This section acts as a meta-directory: it does not host the data itself, but
  points to reputable external datasets and repositories across multiple
  domains.


  ## Features

  - **Curated time-series focus**  
    Specifically targets datasets where observations are ordered in time, supporting forecasting, anomaly detection, temporal pattern mining, and similar tasks.

  - **Wide domain coverage**  
    Includes links to time-series datasets from multiple real-world domains, such as:
    - **Industrial and sensor data** – e.g., machine and process monitoring, industrial telemetry, equipment logs.
    - **National and economic statistics** – e.g., macroeconomic indicators, government statistics, official time-indexed reports.
    - **Hardware and system failure logs** – event logs or monitoring series capturing failures and reliability metrics over time.
    - **Biomedical and physiological signals** – e.g., ECG/EEG and other medical time-series signals and monitoring data.
    - **Academic time-series repositories** – collections maintained by universities, labs, or research projects.

  - **Part of a larger “Awesome” ecosystem**  
    Integrated into the broader *Awesome Public Datasets* list, making it easy to discover related non-time-series datasets in other categories (e.g., computer vision, NLP, finance, etc.).

  - **Public and realistic datasets**  
    Emphasis on datasets that are publicly accessible and representative of realistic, applied scenarios rather than purely synthetic examples.

  - **Meta-directory structure**  
    Acts as an entry point to many independent dataset providers rather than maintaining a single monolithic archive.

  - **GitHub-based curation**  
    Hosted on GitHub, benefiting from community-driven updates, pull requests, and issue tracking.

  ## Usage

  - Browse the **Time Series** section in the repository’s README to locate
  datasets matching a specific domain or research problem.

  - Follow outbound links to download datasets from their original hosts and
  review their individual licenses and documentation.


  ## Pricing

  - **Access to the directory:** Free (open GitHub repository).  

  - **Dataset costs:** Typically free/public, but actual terms, licenses, and
  any usage restrictions are determined by each external dataset provider and
  must be checked individually.
