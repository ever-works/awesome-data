  - `contributing.md` outlines how to propose additions or changes to the list.
  - `add-studio.ts` provides a scripted way to add new studios or groups to the dataset.
  - `UP.md` and `CLOSED.md` provide project status and/or maintenance notes.

- **Licensing and governance**
  - A `LICENSE` file defines the open-source terms for using and contributing to the list.
