## Overview

Awesome Arch-based Projects is a curated list of operating systems and tools that are based on Arch Linux, use its package ecosystem, or are strongly inspired by it. It organizes both Linux and non-Linux projects, installers, AUR helpers, and derivatives into clear sections for easy discovery.

## Features

### Structured Categories
- **Arch-based projects**
  - **Linux**
    - Focus: Distributions strongly inspired by Arch Linux.
    - Examples:
      - **Arch Linux 32** – Community-maintained continuation of 32‑bit support for Arch Linux.
      - **Arch Linux ARM** – Arch-based distribution for ARM computers.
  - **Not Linux**
    - Focus: Non-Linux projects based on or derived from Arch.
    - Examples:
      - **PacBSD** – Lightweight and flexible BSD distribution using the `pacman` package manager.
      - **Arch Hurd** – Port of Arch Linux to the GNU Hurd system, optimized for i686.
      - **ArchWSL** – Arch Linux as a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instance.

- **Arch-based distros**
  - **Desktop** (general-use Arch-based Linux distributions)
    - **Manjaro** – Linux distribution based on Arch Linux intended as a replacement for Windows or macOS.
    - **ArcoLinux** – Full-featured Arch-based distribution.
    - **ArchBang Linux** – Lightweight Arch-based distribution.
    - **Archcraft OS** – Minimalistic, aesthetics-focused Arch-based distribution.
    - **Archman** – Arch-based distribution with Calamares system installer and pre-configured desktop environment.
    - **Bluestar Linux** – Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution.
    - **Crystal Linux** – New Arch-based distribution aiming to be beginner friendly, easy to use, and powerful.
    - **CachyOS** – Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution featuring an optimized `linux-cachyos` kernel with the BORE scheduler for performance.
    - **EndeavourOS** – Rolling-release Linux distribution based on Arch Linux.
    - **ArchLabs Linux** – Arch-based distribution featuring the Openbox window manager as the primary desktop interface.
    - **Namib GNU/Linux** – Desktop operating system based on and compatible with Arch Linux (description truncated in source).

- **Additional sections (listed in table of contents)**
  - **Specific purpose Arch-based distros** – Arch derivatives tailored for particular use-cases (details not fully shown in excerpt).
  - **Pacman-based Linux distros** – Distributions using the `pacman` package manager (not necessarily strictly Arch-based).
  - **SystemD-free Arch-based distros** – Arch derivatives that do not use systemd.
  - **Arch Linux Installers** – Tools to simplify installing Arch Linux.
  - **AUR Helpers** – Tools for interacting with the Arch User Repository (AUR), organized into:
    - Search and download
    - Search and build
    - Pacman wrappers
    - Graphical AUR helpers
    - Maintenance tools
    - Other helper types
  - **Other projects** – Additional Arch-related tools or initiatives.
  - **Inactive projects** – Historical or no-longer-maintained Arch-based efforts.

### Focus on Arch Linux Ecosystem
- Highlights Arch Linux as a minimal, user-configured base system focused on simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance.
- Emphasizes derivatives that extend Arch to different architectures (x86-64, 32-bit, ARM) and platforms (BSD, GNU Hurd, WSL).
