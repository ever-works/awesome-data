## Overview
Awesome Natural Language Generation is a curated, open directory of resources focused on Natural Language Generation (NLG). It aggregates links to projects, tools, datasets, research papers, and learning materials covering a wide range of NLG applications such as chatbots, story and narrative generation, and data-to-text description.

## Features
- **Broad NLG Coverage**
  - Focus on Natural Language Generation across multiple use cases, including:
    - Conversational agents and dialog systems
    - Story and narrative generation
    - Data-to-text and report generation
  - Emphasis on representing the diversity of NLG applications and techniques.

- **Curated Resource Categories** (as outlined in the README contents):
  - **Datasets** – Collections of data useful for training and evaluating NLG systems.
  - **Dialog** – Tools, frameworks, and resources for dialog and conversational NLG.
  - **Evaluation** – Methods, metrics, and tools for assessing NLG quality.
