  **Category:** Meta-directories

  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Extensions is a meta-directory that aggregates and organizes
  “awesome” lists focused on extensions. It links out to curated collections
  covering different types of extensions, such as browser, editor, and tool
  extensions.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-directory of extension lists**  
    - Collects multiple “awesome” lists that are specifically about extensions rather than general software.  
    - Acts as a directory-of-directories so users can discover many curated lists from one place.

  - **Covers multiple extension types**  
    - Browser extensions (e.g., productivity, privacy, developer tools).  
    - Editor/IDE extensions (e.g., plugins for code editors, language support, tooling).  
    - Tool and utility extensions (e.g., plugins for CLIs, frameworks, workflows).

  - **GitHub-based curation**  
    - Hosted as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository.  
    - Leverages the existing “awesome list” ecosystem and conventions (stars, contributions, pull requests).

  - **Structured navigation**  
    - Links grouped by extension category or type of host tool (browser, editor, etc.).  
    - Each entry points to an external awesome list with its own detailed content.

  - **Community-updatable**  
    - Maintained in a public repo, allowing users to suggest new awesome lists or updates via standard GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests) when enabled by the repo maintainers.

  ## Pricing

  - Not a commercial product or service.  

  - Publicly accessible GitHub document; no pricing or plans.
