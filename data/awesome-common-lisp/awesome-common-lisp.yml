  ## Overview

  Awesome Common Lisp is an Awesome-style curated directory of Common Lisp
  libraries, frameworks, tools, and resources. It focuses on high-quality,
  practically useful packages, mostly available via Quicklisp, and highlights
  widely adopted “community standard” libraries as well as promising newer
  options.


  ## Features

  - **Curated library list**
    - Focus on Common Lisp frameworks, libraries, and related tools.
    - Emphasis on quality, usefulness, and practical adoption.

  - **Quicklisp integration focus**
    - Nearly all listed libraries are available through Quicklisp unless explicitly noted otherwise.
    - Helps users find packages that are easy to install and manage in real-world Lisp projects.

  - **Community standard markers**
    - Libraries marked with ⭐ are considered community standards: widely used, stable, and trusted (e.g., Quicklisp, BordeauxThreads).
    - Allows quick identification of safe defaults for new and existing projects.

  - **Recommended / promoted libraries**
    - Libraries marked with 👍 are recommended by the maintainers.
    - These may offer better solutions than standards in some areas but are less widespread or not yet as mature.
    - Example guidance: preference for Spinneret over Cl-Who for certain use cases.

  - **Ecosystem context and cross-links**
    - Links to additional resources and related lists, such as:
      - Lisp success stories on lisp-lang.org.
      - The separate `awesome-cl-software` list for real-world software written in Common Lisp.

  - **Open contribution model**
    - Public contributing guidelines (via a `contributing` section) inviting community submissions and improvements.

  - **GitHub-based directory**
    - Hosted as a GitHub repository (`CodyReichert/awesome-cl`).
    - Standard project files (README, LICENSE, CI configuration, etc.) support transparency, collaboration, and maintenance.

  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. Awesome Common Lisp is an open, GitHub-hosted curated list
  available free of charge.
