  # Quantum Simulations of an Electron in a 2D Potential Well Dataset


  **Category:** Datasets  

  **Tags:** datasets, physics, quantum-computing  

  **Source / DOI:** http://doi.org/10.4224/PhysRevA.96.042113.data


  ## Overview

  Open research dataset generated from numerical simulations of an electron in a
  two-dimensional confining potential. The data was used to train deep neural
  networks to reproduce solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation
  and serves as a benchmark for quantum simulation, numerical modeling, and
  physics-focused deep learning.
