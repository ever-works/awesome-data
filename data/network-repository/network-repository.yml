  ## Description

  Network Repository provides a large collection of complex network datasets and
  integrates with an interactive, web-based platform (GraphVis) for visual graph
  data mining and machine learning. Users can load datasets directly from the
  repository or upload their own network files, then explore and analyze them in
  real time via a browser.
