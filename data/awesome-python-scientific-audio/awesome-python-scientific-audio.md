## Features

### Curated Audio Package Directory
- Focused specifically on **Python** tools for **scientific audio and music research**.
- Organized into topical sections (as indicated in the README), including for example:
  - **Audio Related Packages**
  - **Read–Write** libraries for audio data
  - **Transformations / General DSP** tools
- Each entry points to external repositories or packages (e.g., GitHub projects) relevant to the topic.

### Audio Read–Write Libraries
- Collection of Python packages for:
  - Reading audio files in various formats
  - Writing audio data back to disk
  - Handling audio I/O for experiments and research workflows

### Transformations & General DSP
- Directory of libraries for:
  - Signal transformations
  - General digital signal processing on audio
  - Feature extraction and processing suitable for scientific workflows

### Research-Oriented Scope
- Emphasis on tools **actively used in scientific research** in:
  - Audio signal processing
  - Music information retrieval and music technology
  - Related audio/multimedia domains

### Community & Maintenance
- Hosted as a **GitHub repository** (`faroit/awesome-python-scientific-audio`).
- Includes contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) for adding and maintaining entries.
- Uses GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows`) to validate or check the list (e.g., formatting, links) as indicated by the CI badge.

### Awesome List Integration
- Part of the broader **Awesome** ecosystem, indicated by the Awesome badge.
- Follows common awesome-list conventions for layout and curation.
