  # Awesome Computational Neuroscience


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** neuroscience, science, awesome-lists


  ## Overview

  Awesome Computational Neuroscience is a curated, GitHub-hosted directory of
  schools, principal investigators (PIs), and research groups working in
  computational, theoretical, and systems neuroscience worldwide. It is
  structured as an “awesome list” and focuses on helping students, researchers,
  and practitioners discover institutions and advisors active in computational
  approaches to studying the nervous system.


  Computational neuroscience is presented as a multidisciplinary field combining
  biology/neuroscience, medicine, biophysics, psychology, computer science,
  mathematics, and statistics.


  ## Features

  - **Global directory of researchers and schools**  
    - Focus on computational neuroscience, theoretical neuroscience, and systems neuroscience.  
    - Organized geographically (e.g., Europe → Germany → specific institutes like INI).  
    - Aims to give a broad, international view of the field.

  - **Principal Investigator (PI) listings**  
    - Names of PIs and associated institutions or departments.  
    - Short excerpts from academic biographies describing research focus.  
    - Links to publications where available.

  - **Computational-focus rating per researcher**  
    - Qualitative indicator of how computational a PI’s work is, using a three-level scale:  
      - **(+) Computational**:  
        - University identifies the PI as a computational neuroscientist.  
        - Bio describes a substantial component of research in computational neuroscience.  
        - Has a significant body of work in the field.  
      - **(=) Occasionally computational**:  
        - University identifies the PI as doing computational research.  
        - Has occasionally produced articles in computational neuroscience.  
      - **(-) Minimally evidenced computational work**:  
        - University identifies the PI as practicing computational neuroscience.  
        - Bio might mention computational neuroscience.  
        - Articles clearly representing computational neuroscience could not be found.  
    - Ratings are subjective and may change over time as researchers publish more.

  - **Research area descriptions**  
    - For each PI, tabular entries may include:  
      - Research areas or themes (e.g., modeling of complex neural networks).  
      - Short textual descriptions of methodologies and scientific focus (such as mathematical modeling, computer simulation of complex networks).

  - **Structured tables by institution**  
    - Example structure:  
      - Institute (e.g., INI in Germany).  
      - Table columns like:  
        - PI (Ph.D.s)  
        - Research Areas  
        - Research (free-text description)  
        - +/=/- computational rating.

  - **Contribution guidelines**  
    - A `contributing.md` file defines how to add or update entries.  
    - Encourages community maintenance and expansion of the list.

  - **Open license**  
    - Includes a `LICENSE` file, allowing reuse and contribution under open terms (exact license details are in the repository file).

  ## Use Cases

  - Finding potential Ph.D. or postdoctoral advisors in computational
  neuroscience.  

  - Exploring which universities and institutes host computational or
  theoretical neuroscience groups.  

  - Getting a quick sense of how strongly a given PI’s work is oriented toward
  computational methods.


  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. This is a free, open-source, GitHub-hosted directory/awesome
  list with no pricing or plans.
