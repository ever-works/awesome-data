  # Awesome CircuitPython


  **Category:** Themed directories  

  **Website:** https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython#readme  

  **Creator / Brand:** Adafruit


  An open, curated directory of guides, videos, libraries, frameworks, software,
  and other learning resources for working with **CircuitPython**, Adafruit’s
  beginner‑friendly branch of MicroPython for microcontrollers.

  ## Overview


  Awesome CircuitPython is an "awesome list"–style collection focused on the
  CircuitPython ecosystem. It aggregates educational and technical resources to
  help people:


  - Learn what CircuitPython is and how it differs from other microcontroller
  platforms

  - Discover supported hardware boards and download matching firmware

  - Find libraries, frameworks, and tools to build projects in Python on
  microcontrollers

  - Explore community-created guides, videos, and reference material


  CircuitPython itself is designed to simplify experimentation and education on
  low-cost microcontrollers by allowing you to write Python code to control
  hardware, avoiding lower-level languages like C or C++.
