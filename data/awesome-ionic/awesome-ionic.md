## Overview
Awesome Ionic is a curated, community-maintained directory of resources for building hybrid and mobile applications with the Ionic framework.

- **Visual assets for identification and sharing**
  - Logos and images for Ionic and Angular (`ionic.png`, `angular.png`, `awesome-ionic.png`, `pwa.png`, `ionicitalia.jpg`) to visually brand the list and related content.
