  ## Overview
  meta-awesome – Natural Language Processing is a curated subdirectory within the broader `meta-awesome` project. It indexes and organizes "awesome" lists that focus specifically on natural language processing (NLP) tools, libraries, datasets, tutorials, and other resources. Instead of being a single NLP toolkit, it acts as a directory of many community-maintained NLP awesome lists.

  ---

  ## Features
  - **Meta-directory for NLP awesome lists**  
    Aggregates multiple "awesome"-style lists related to NLP into a single index.

  - **Focus on NLP ecosystem**  
    Targets resources specifically in natural language processing, such as:
    - Libraries and frameworks for NLP
    - NLP tools and utilities
    - Educational resources and tutorials (where included in source lists)
    - Datasets and benchmarks (where included in source lists)

  - **Part of the meta-awesome project**  
    Functions as one documented subdirectory (`doc/natural-language-processing.md`) within the `jepemo/meta-awesome` GitHub repository, which organizes awesome lists by topic.

  - **Git-based, community-friendly format**  
    Provided as a Markdown document in a public GitHub repository, suitable for:
    - Browsing online
    - Cloning or forking for personal use
    - Contributions via GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests) following the parent repo’s contribution practices.

  - **Stable source URL**  
    The NLP index is accessible directly via a canonical GitHub URL, enabling linking or embedding in other documentation.

  ## Pricing
  - Not a commercial product or service.  
  - Public GitHub repository; usage and access are free, subject to the repository’s open-source license and GitHub’s terms of service.
