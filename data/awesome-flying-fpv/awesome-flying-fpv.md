## Overview
Awesome Flying FPV is a curated, open-source directory of free software and open hardware projects for FPV flying, multicopters, fixed‑wing aircraft, VTOLs, and other UAVs. It focuses on established projects with active communities and historically important “classic” projects that still offer valuable mods and knowledge.

The goal is to help builders, pilots, and developers navigate the open-source UAV ecosystem, from complete airframes down to components, mission control, and tooling.

## Features

### Scope and Focus
- Dedicated to FPV flying, multicopters, airplanes, and flying wings
- Emphasis on **free software** and **open hardware** projects
- Includes both actively maintained and legacy/classic projects with significant modding ecosystems
- Oriented toward DIY builders, tinkerers, and open-source contributors

### Structured Directory of UAV Topics
The list is organized into clearly defined sections covering the full UAV stack:

### Guidance and Educational Aspects
- Provides orientation for beginners and intermediates on where to start in the open UAV ecosystem
- Highlights that building a UAV from scratch is challenging and suggests:
  - Starting with existing solutions or kits
  - Progressing to modifications and custom builds after gaining experience
- Emphasizes safety, good airmanship, and awareness of local regulations
- Explicit statement of peaceful and research/learning intent for UAV technology

## Licensing / Openness
- Focuses specifically on **Free Software** projects and **Open Hardware** designs
- Encourages use, modification, and contribution within open-source ecosystems

## Pricing
- Not a commercial product or service; it is a free, open-source curated list.
- No pricing plans or paid tiers are associated with the directory itself.
