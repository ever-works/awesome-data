  ## Key Collections & Data Releases


  ### HCP-Young Adult 2025

  - **Release date:** Aug 11, 2025  

  - **Scope:** Updated processing of previously released 3T and 7T imaging data
  (no new subjects).  

  - **Processed data:** 1071 subjects.  

  - **Unprocessed imaging data:** 1113 subjects.  

  - **Phenotypic non-imaging data:** 1206 subjects.  

  - **MEG and 7T MR data:** Available for a subset of subjects (twin pairs).  

  - **Processing updates:**  
    - Spatial and temporal ICA on all fMRI data.  
    - Bias field correction on all fMRI data.  
    - Repackaged to match HCP Lifespan project data package structure.  
    - Removal of processed datasets with previous processing errors and/or without a complete rfMRI run needed for MSMAll registration.

  ## Features

  - Large-scale, openly accessible neuroimaging and phenotypic datasets focused
  on healthy young adults.  

  - Multi-modal imaging: 3T MRI, 7T MRI, diffusion MRI, and MEG for selected
  subsets.  

  - Extensive behavioral and non-imaging phenotypic measures for the full
  cohort.  

  - Multiple processing levels: unprocessed, minimally processed, and
  extensively processed (including group-level products).  

  - Advanced fMRI processing: spatial/temporal ICA, bias field correction,
  functional connectivity measures.  

  - Advanced diffusion processing: updated motion-noise–reduction pipelines and
  bedpostX analyses.  

  - Group-level products: structural and tfMRI averages, functional connectivity
  matrices, ICA-based parcellations, timeseries, and network matrices.  

  - Intersubject registration using cortical folding (MSM-Sulc) and multimodal
  (MSM-All) approaches.  

  - Harmonized packaging to align with HCP Lifespan projects for easier
  cross-project use.  

  - Detailed release documentation for each dataset.
