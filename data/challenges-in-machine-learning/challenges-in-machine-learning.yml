  # Challenges in Machine Learning


  **Brand:** ChaLearn  

  **Category:** Data Competitions  

  **Website:** http://www.chalearn.org/  

  **Slug:** `challenges-in-machine-learning`


  ## Overview


  ChaLearn’s *Challenges in Machine Learning* is a recurring series of open
  machine learning competitions and benchmarks. It provides datasets and
  challenge environments to advance research in areas such as computer vision,
  fairness in physics simulations, medical ML, power systems control, and
  automated machine learning. The series often runs in conjunction with major
  conferences like NeurIPS, ICCV, and on platforms such as Kaggle and Codalab.


  ## Features


  ### General Platform & Community

  - Recurring machine learning challenge series across multiple domains.

  - Public datasets and benchmarks made available to the research community.

  - Integration with and active support for the **Codalab** competition
  platform.

  - Community participation via the Codalab-competitions mailing list.

  - Challenges often co-located with major ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICCV).


  ### Challenge Series


  #### LAP: Looking at People

  - Focus: Computer vision tasks centered on humans (detection, recognition,
  interaction).

  - Goal: Push state of the art in human-centric vision.

  - Current activity: **Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge, ICCV 2025**.


  #### Fair Universe

  - Focus: Bias and fairness in **High Energy Physics simulations**.

  - Provides challenge settings where models must address or quantify bias.

  - Includes a **NeurIPS 2025 challenge** on this topic.


  #### MediChal

  - Focus: Medical applications of machine learning.

  - Includes challenges such as the **NeurIPS 2025 EEG challenge**.

  - Targets clinically relevant ML use cases and datasets.


  #### L2RPN (Learning to Run a Power Network)

  - Focus: Control and operation of power transmission grids (notably, the
  French electricity transmission grid).

  - Real-world setting for reinforcement learning / control algorithms.

  - Includes large-scale competitions, such as the **2023 million-dollar prize**
  funded by the Paris Region.


  #### AutoML

  - Focus: Automated machine learning methods and systems.

  - Hosted challenges on external platforms, e.g., **Kaggle 2024 AutoML Grand
  Prix**.

  - Benchmarks end-to-end AutoML pipelines and methods.


  ### Conference & Platform Integration

  - **ICCV**: Face Anti-Spoofing challenge (2025) under the LAP series.

  - **NeurIPS 2025**: 
    - Fair Universe challenge (bias in physics simulations).
    - MediChal EEG challenge (medical/EEG focus).
  - **Kaggle**: AutoML Grand Prix (2024) as part of the AUTOML series.

  - **Codalab**: Used and supported as a core competition hosting platform.
