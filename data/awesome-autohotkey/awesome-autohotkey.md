## Overview
Awesome AutoHotkey is a curated, community-maintained directory of AutoHotkey libraries, script collections, tools, and learning resources. It organizes the AutoHotkey ecosystem into clear sections so users can find reusable code, development utilities, and documentation for Windows automation and scripting.

Out-of-date or discontinued but historically relevant items are kept in a separate `Historical.md` listing.

## Features

### Scope and Structure
- Curated list focused on AutoHotkey scripting for Windows automation.

  - **Scripts**
  - **Tools**
  - **Tutorials**
  - **Resources**
  - **Forks** (e.g., AutoHotkey_H)
- Separate **Historical** section for outdated but relevant projects.

### Libraries

- **Database** – helpers for interacting with databases.
- **Filesystem** – file and directory utilities.
- **Graphics** – drawing and image-related helpers.
- **GUI** – window and UI creation helpers/components.
- **Hotkeys** – advanced hotkey handling and binding utilities.
- **Joystick** – joystick and game controller handling.
- **Maths** – numeric and mathematical helper functions.
- **Memory** – low-level memory operations and utilities.
- **Networking** – HTTP, sockets, and related networking helpers.
- **Plotting** – graphs, charts, bars, and other data visualizations.
- **System** – OS and system-level interaction helpers.
- **Text manipulation** – string processing and text utilities.
