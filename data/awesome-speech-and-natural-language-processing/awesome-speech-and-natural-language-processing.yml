  ## Overview
  Awesome Speech and Natural Language Processing is an “awesome-style” curated directory of resources covering speech technology and NLP. It aggregates tools, libraries, datasets, learning materials, and applications across multiple subdomains of speech and language processing.

  ## Features
  - **Curated, Awesome-style list**  
    - Follows the popular "Awesome" list format for organizing high-quality, vetted resources.
    - Subcategories are listed in alphabetical order for easier navigation.

  - **Finite State Toolkits and Regular Expressions**  
    - Collection of toolkits for finite-state methods.  
    - Includes resources that often overlap with machine translation tools and provide graph and semiring operations.

  - **Language Modelling Toolkits**  
    - Toolkits and libraries for building and experimenting with language models.

  - **Speech Recognition**  
    - Resources for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, libraries, and frameworks.

  - **Signal Processing**  
    - Tools and libraries for low-level audio and speech signal processing.

  - **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
    - Resources for converting text to synthetic speech, including engines and toolkits.

  - **Speech Data**  
    - Links to speech datasets and corpora used for training and evaluating speech systems.

  - **Machine Translation**  
    - Resources for MT systems, many of which also implement advanced graph and semiring operations.

  - **Machine Learning**  
    - General ML tools and libraries relevant to speech and language tasks.

  - **Deep Learning**  
    - Deep learning frameworks, models, and examples applied to speech and NLP.

  - **Natural Language Processing**  
    - Broad NLP resources: toolkits, frameworks, and libraries for text processing and understanding.

  - **Applications**  
    - Examples and references to end-user or research applications built on speech and NLP technologies.

  - **Other Tools**  
    - Miscellaneous utilities and tools that support speech and NLP workflows.

  - **Blogs**  
    - Curated list of blogs and online publications focused on speech and NLP.

  - **Books**  
    - References to books and long-form resources for deeper study of speech and natural language processing.

  - **Open contribution model**  
    - Contributions are accepted via pull requests, allowing the community to extend and update the list.

  ## Pricing
