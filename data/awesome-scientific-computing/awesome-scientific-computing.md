# Awesome Scientific Computing

A curated, community-maintained directory of software, libraries, and tools for numerical analysis and scientific computing.

Scientific computing and numerical analysis focus on solving large-scale scientific problems using computers, including ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs), their discretizations, and the resulting linear algebra problems.
