  # Meta Awesome – IDE


  **Category:** Meta Directories  

  **Website:** <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/ide.md>


  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – IDE is a curated, Awesome-style sub-list within the broader
  Meta Awesome project, focused specifically on Integrated Development
  Environments (IDEs). It aggregates links to IDE tools, plugins, and related
  resources to help developers discover, compare, and explore IDE ecosystems
  from a single, structured page.


  ## Features

  - **Curated IDE directory**
    - Collects a wide range of IDEs and IDE-related tools in a single list.
    - Focuses on Integrated Development Environments rather than general-purpose developer tools.

  - **Awesome-style organization**
    - Follows the familiar "Awesome list" format: headings, bullet lists, and concise descriptions.
    - Designed for quick scanning and link discovery.

  - **Part of Meta Awesome collection**
    - Integrated into the larger Meta Awesome project, which aggregates multiple topic-specific Awesome lists.
    - IDE page is a singular-focused document (`doc/ide.md`) dedicated to IDE content.

  - **Resource-centric entries**
    - Each entry links out to an external IDE, plugin, or resource.
    - Short, descriptive text helps differentiate tools at a glance.

  - **Developer tooling focus**
    - Emphasis on tools used in software development workflows (coding, debugging, project management within IDEs).

  - **Continuous enhancement potential**
    - Hosted on GitHub, allowing community members to suggest additions and improvements via pull requests or issues (standard for GitHub-hosted lists).

  ## Use Cases

  - Discovering new IDEs or comparing available options.

  - Finding plugins, extensions, or related tools for existing IDEs.

  - Using as a reference hub when setting up or teaching development
  environments.


  ## Pricing

  - The Meta Awesome – IDE list itself is a free, open repository page on
  GitHub.  

  - No paid plans or pricing tiers are associated with the directory content.
