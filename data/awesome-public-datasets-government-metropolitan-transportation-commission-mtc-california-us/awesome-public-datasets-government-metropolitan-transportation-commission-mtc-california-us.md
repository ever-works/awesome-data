## Features

### Open Data Catalog & Spatial Library
- Public-facing open data catalog for MTC datasets.  
- **Spatial Library** focused on geospatial data used for mapping and visualization.  
- Data suitable for illustrating trends and information geographically (e.g., transportation networks, regional planning layers, spatial indicators).  
- Intended users include the general public, planners, developers, and programmers.  
- Supports exploration of data to:
  - Stay informed about Bay Area transportation and planning.  
  - Pursue independent or institutional research.  
  - Develop tools or ideas to address regional problems.  
- Ability to **submit data requests** for additional or specific spatial datasets.

### Modeling Library
- **MTC‑ABAG Modeling Library** providing analytical and modeling resources.  
- Contains data and model outputs describing:
  - Where Bay Area residents live and work.  
  - How they travel (modes and patterns).  
  - Demographic attributes: ages, genders, incomes, and occupations.  
- Supports scenario analysis, forecasting, and policy evaluation related to transportation and land-use planning.

### Mapping & Visualization Support
- **Request Mapping Services** for spatial mapping projects.  
- Access to MTC’s **Data Visualization team** for assistance with:
  - Designing and producing maps.  
  - Using MTC spatial data effectively in visual products.  
- Useful for projects needing professional-quality mapping based on regional transportation and planning data.

### General Characteristics
- Data used internally by MTC for maps, charts, planning analyses, and forecasts is made accessible to external users.  
- Supports evidence-based decision-making for MTC Commissioners and other public policymakers.  
- Encourages external use for transparency, public engagement, and innovation around Bay Area transportation and regional planning.
