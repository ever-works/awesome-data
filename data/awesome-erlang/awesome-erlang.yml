  ## Overview

  Awesome Erlang is a curated, community-driven directory of Erlang libraries,
  tools, and learning resources. It is organized as an “awesome-style” list and
  covers many areas of the Erlang ecosystem, from web development and
  distributed systems to testing, monitoring, and educational materials.


  ## Features
