  # awesome-startups


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** startups, business-tools, awesome-lists


  A GitHub-hosted, automatically updated directory of the top 100 startups
  worldwide, plus country-specific startup lists, based on data from
  Startupranking.


  ---


  ## Overview


  `awesome-startups` is an open-source curated list that aggregates startup
  rankings from [startupranking.com](http://startupranking.com). It maintains:


  - A global list of the top 100 startups

  - Per-country lists of startups

  - A ranking-based structure that’s regenerated regularly using a PHP script
  and JSON data files


  The project follows the broader `awesome-*` list convention and is designed as
  a reference resource for founders, researchers, and startup enthusiasts.

  ## Features


  - **Global Top 100 List**  
    - Maintains a list of the top 100 startups worldwide.  
    - Rankings are sourced directly from Startupranking and ordered by rank.

  - **Country-based Startup Lists**  
    - `countries/` directory contains per-country startup lists.  
    - Countries are sorted in descending order by the number of startups associated with each country.  
    - Within each country file, startups are sorted in ascending order of their rankings.

  - **Automated Daily Updates**  
    - A PHP script (`fetch-countries.php` and `index.php`) fetches and processes the latest data from startupranking.com.  
    - Lists are regenerated on a daily basis to keep rankings current.  
    - README includes a `Last Updated On` timestamp indicating the last successful update.

  - **Structured Data Source Handling**  
    - Uses `supported-countries.json` to track which countries are supported (i.e., have startups registered on Startupranking).  
    - Script logic “crunches” raw ranking data into structured lists used in the README and country files.

  - **Open-source Repository Layout**  
    - `README.md` – main listing and documentation.  
    - `countries/` – country-wise startup listings.  
    - `supported-countries.json` – machine-readable list of supported countries.  
    - `pre-readme-content.txt` and `post-readme-content.txt` – template fragments to build the dynamic README.  
    - `LICENSE` – license file (open-source terms).  
    - `.gitignore` – standard Git configuration.

  - **Dynamic README Generation**  
    - README is programmatically generated, combining template files with live data.  
    - Includes a contents section and a data freshness timestamp.

  - **Inspired by `awesome-*` Ecosystem**  
    - Follows conventions of popular “awesome lists” (curated, topic-focused, GitHub-native).
