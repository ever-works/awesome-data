## Overview
Awesome Web Performance Budget is a curated directory of resources focused on defining, implementing, and enforcing performance budgets for websites. It aggregates links to educational content, tooling, and real-world examples that help teams keep web performance within agreed limits throughout design and development.

## What is a Web Performance Budget?
A web performance budget is a set of limits on metrics that affect site performance (such as page weight, number of requests, or load times). These constraints guide design and development decisions so that performance, speed, and user experience remain within desired targets.
