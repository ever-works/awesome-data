## Crystallography Open Database

**Website:** http://www.crystallography.net/  
**Category:** Datasets  
**Domains:** Physics, Chemistry, Crystallography

### Overview
The Crystallography Open Database (COD) is an open-access collection of crystallographic data for inorganic, metal–organic and small organic molecule structures. It aims to gather all available published structural data into a single, searchable resource for the scientific community.

### Features
- **Open-access model**  
  - Free access to all included structure files.  
  - Data provided without paywalls for research and educational use.

- **Comprehensive structural coverage**  
  - Focus on inorganic compounds, metal–organic structures and small organic molecules.  
  - Nearly complete coverage of structural data published by the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) at the time of description.  
  - Integrates data contributed from multiple sources, including the American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database (AMCSD) and various laboratories.

- **Large and growing dataset**  
  - Contains approximately 80,000 crystallographic entries (at the time of the referenced article).  
  - Continuous growth through uploads by individuals, laboratories and institutional partners.  
  - Includes a dedicated subset, PCOD (Predicted Crystallography Open Database), for predicted structures.

- **Standardized data format**  
  - All entries stored in Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format.  
  - Uses the CIF2COD program (derived from CIF2SX) to help ensure quality and standardization of uploaded files.

- **Web-based access and tools**  
  - Accessible via a web interface at crystallography.net.  
  - Straightforward search and retrieval interface for locating structures.  
  - PHP/MySQL-based backend for handling database queries and data management.

- **Community-driven initiative**  
  - Initiated and maintained by an international group of crystallographers.  
  - Accepts contributions from individuals and laboratories.  
  - Built to address the historical fragmentation of structural data across several specialized databases by offering a unified resource.

### Data Types / Scope
- Inorganic crystal structures.
- Metal–organic frameworks and related structures.
- Small organic molecule structures.

### Access & Licensing
- Described as an open-access database; users can freely search and retrieve structure files.  
- (Specific license terms are not detailed in the provided content and should be checked on the official site.)

### Pricing
- No pricing information is mentioned in the provided content; the database is described as open-access, implying free use for data search and retrieval.
