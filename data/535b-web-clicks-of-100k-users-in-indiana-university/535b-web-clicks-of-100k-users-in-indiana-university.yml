  # 53.5B Web Clicks of 100K Users in Indiana University

  ## Overview
  A large-scale clickstream dataset of approximately **53.5 billion HTTP requests** collected at Indiana University (IU), capturing web browsing activity of about **100,000 anonymized users**. The data supports research on web traffic networks, user browsing behavior, recommendation systems, and network traffic patterns.

  Data was captured at IU’s border router using packet-level collection, enabling analysis of real user navigation paths (via referrer information) while minimizing biases typical of server logs or browser-based data.

  ## Features

  ### Scope and Scale
  - ~53.5 billion HTTP GET requests
  - ~60 million requests per day
  - ~30 GB/day of raw traffic during collection
  - Collection period: **September 2006 – May 2010**
  - Data missing for about **275 days** total
  - Approximately **0.85 TB** (raw) + **1.5 TB** (raw-url) compressed

  ### Collections
  1. **`raw` collection**
     - ~25 billion requests
     - Referrer: only **host name** of the referrer retained
     - Time span: **26 Sep 2006 – 3 Mar 2008**
     - Missing 98 days of data (including entire **June 2007**)
     - Size: ~**0.85 TB**, compressed

  2. **`raw-url` collection**
     - ~28.6 billion requests
     - Referrer: **full referrer URL** retained
     - Time span: **3 Mar 2008 – 31 May 2010**
     - Missing 179 days of data, including full months of **Dec 2008, Jan 2009, Feb 2009**
     - Size: ~**1.5 TB**, compressed

  ### Data Collection Methodology
  - Source: Mirror of traffic passing through **Indiana University’s border router**
  - Filter: **Berkeley Packet Filter** matching all traffic to **TCP port 80**
  - Tooling: Long-running collection process using the **pcap** library
  - Extraction: Regular expressions applied to packet payloads to identify **HTTP GET** requests
  - Only requests are logged; server responses are not analyzed
  - No TCP stream reassembly performed

  ### Recorded Fields per Request
  Each logged record includes:
  - **Timestamp** (32-bit Unix epoch in seconds, little-endian)
  - **Requested URL** (split into `host` and `path` fields)
  - **Referring URL / host** (depending on collection: hostname only or full URL)
  - **User agent classification**:
    - Browser (`"B"`) vs. other/unknown/bot (`"?"`)
  - **Direction flag** (traffic origin/destination relative to IU):
    - `"I"` – External traffic to IU (outside → IU)
    - `"O"` – Internal traffic from IU to the outside (IU → outside)

  ### Traffic Coverage and Sampling Notes
  1. **Inside vs. outside IU traffic**
     - "Outside IU" traffic: requests from **outside IU** for **pages inside IU**
     - "Inside IU" traffic: requests from **people at IU (~100,000 users)** for **resources outside IU**
     - These two sets have different and important sampling biases

  2. **Anonymization and privacy**
     - No client-identifying data retained:
       - No MAC addresses
       - No IP addresses
       - No unique client indices

  3. **Limitations**
     - No stream reassembly; only individual packets with GET requests
     - Server responses not logged
     - Only HTTP (port 80) traffic captured

  ### File Organization and Format
  - Dataset is **broken into hourly files**
  - First line of each file: a set of flags (can be ignored by most users)
  - Each record has the structure:

    ```
    XXXXADreferrer
    host
    path
    ```

    Where:
    - `XXXX` – 32-bit Unix epoch timestamp (seconds, little-endian)
    - `A` – User-agent flag:
      - `"B"` = browser
      - `"?"` = other (including bots)
    - `D` – Direction flag:
      - `"I"` = external traffic to IU
      - `"O"` = internal traffic from IU to outside
    - `referrer` – Referrer hostname or full URL (newline-terminated)
    - `host` – Target hostname (newline-terminated)
    - `path` – Target path (newline-terminated)

  ## Potential Applications
  - Modeling the **structure and dynamics of web traffic networks**
  - Studying **user browsing behavior** and navigation paths
  - Developing and evaluating **recommendation systems**
  - Analyzing **network traffic patterns** and workload characteristics
  - Designing and optimizing **network infrastructure**, **websites**, and **server software**
  - **Forecasting traffic trends**
  - **Classifying websites** by activity patterns
  - Improving **ranking algorithms** for search results
