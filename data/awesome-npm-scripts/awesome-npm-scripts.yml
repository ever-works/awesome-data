  # Awesome npm Scripts


  **URL:** https://github.com/RyanZim/awesome-npm-scripts#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** awesome-lists, javascript, build-tools


  ## Overview

  Awesome npm Scripts is a curated "awesome list" focused on using npm scripts
  as a task runner and build tool. It aggregates tools, patterns, and resources
  that help developers replace or complement traditional task runners by
  leveraging `npm run` and related utilities.


  ## Features


  ### Core Focus

  - Dedicated to using **npm as a build tool** via `npm run`.

  - Curates tools, patterns, and resources specifically tailored to npm
  script–based workflows.

  - Serves as a central directory for developers building automation around
  package.json scripts.


  ### Content Structure

  - **Articles** – Written resources covering concepts, patterns, and best
  practices for npm scripts and npm-based build pipelines.

  - **Videos/Talks** – Recorded presentations and talks demonstrating
  techniques, real-world usage, and workflows with npm scripts.

  - **Task Runners** – Tools that help orchestrate and run multiple npm scripts
  or shell commands **in parallel or sequentially**, often wrapping `npm run`
  for more complex workflows.

  - **File Watchers** – Utilities that monitor source files and trigger build or
  task commands when changes occur, e.g.:
    - `onchange <glob> -- <command>`
    - `watch <command> <directory>`
  - **Dev Servers** – Tools for running development servers that integrate
  naturally into npm scripts (e.g., for live reload, local development
  environments).

  - **Cross-platform Utilities** – Command-line utilities that abstract away OS
  differences so scripts work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, covering tasks like:
    - `rm -rf` (remove directories/files recursively)
    - `mkdir -p` (create nested directories)
    - `cp -r` (recursive copy)
    - `rsync` (synchronizing files/directories)
    - `echo`, `tee`, `cat` (simple text and stream operations)
  - **Utility Packs** – Bundled cross-platform command shims usable in npm
  scripts, such as:
    - `shx rm somefile` (shell commands exposed as cross-platform Node-based binaries).
  - **Other Utilities** – Miscellaneous tools and helpers that don’t fit the
  above categories but improve npm script workflows (e.g., tooling around
  environment variables, logging, script composition).

  - **Miscellaneous** – Additional npm-script-related items that are useful but
  category-agnostic.

  - **Cross-platform Shell Reference** – A quick-reference section listing shell
  operators and commands that behave consistently on Unix-like systems and
  Windows, helping authors write portable npm scripts.
