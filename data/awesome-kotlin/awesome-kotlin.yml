  # Awesome Kotlin


  **Website:** <https://github.com/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin#readme>


  Curated directory of Kotlin libraries, frameworks, tools, and learning
  resources, organized as an open-source “awesome list.”


  ---


  ## Overview


  Awesome Kotlin is a community-maintained collection of high-quality Kotlin
  resources. It aggregates links to libraries, frameworks, tools, articles, and
  other materials useful for Kotlin development across different platforms (JVM,
  Android, multiplatform, and more).


  ---


  ## Features


  - **Curated Kotlin Ecosystem List**  
    Organized set of links to notable Kotlin libraries, frameworks, and tools.

  - **Open Source Repository**  
    Hosted on GitHub, allowing contributions from the community via pull requests and issues.

  - **Structured Repository Layout**  
    Includes multiple directories and files (e.g., `articles`, `src`, app-related folders) to organize content and auxiliary tooling or site code.

  - **Article and Learning Resources Section**  
    An `articles` directory indicates a maintained set of written resources or references for learning and deepening Kotlin knowledge.

  - **Application Support Code**  
    Presence of `app-backend`, `app-backend-dataops`, and `app-frontend` directories suggests tooling or a small app around the list (e.g., a web UI or data processing helpers for the directory).

  - **Project Configuration & Tooling Files**  
    Includes `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `gradle/wrapper`, and `.env.example` for consistent project setup and development workflows.

  - **Backlog & Roadmap Tracking**  
    `Backlog.txt` indicates a maintained to-do list or roadmap for improving and extending the directory.

  - **License Information**  
    A `LICENSE` file clearly defines how the content can be used and shared.

  - **Integration With the Awesome Ecosystem**  
    Branded as part of the general “Awesome” list ecosystem (`sindresorhusawesome`), following common conventions for awesome lists.
