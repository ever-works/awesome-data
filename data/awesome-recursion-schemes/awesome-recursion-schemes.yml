  # Awesome Recursion Schemes


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Brand:** passy  

  **Website:** https://github.com/passy/awesome-recursion-schemes#readme


  ## Overview

  Awesome Recursion Schemes is a curated directory of learning resources focused
  on recursion schemes—composable combinators for traversing and transforming
  nested data structures, primarily in functional programming contexts.


  ## Features

  - **Curated resource list** specifically dedicated to recursion schemes.

  - **Focus on traversal and recursion** over nested data structures using
  composable combinators.

  - **Organized contents** into multiple sections (as indicated in the README
  structure):
    - Introductions
    - Articles (including items such as *Hylomorphisms in the Wild* by Bartosz Milewski, showcasing practical applications of hylomorphisms)
    - Papers
    - Presentations
    - Cheat Sheets
    - Podcasts
    - Implementations
  - **Educational orientation**: resources aimed at both learning the basics and
  applying recursion schemes in practice.

  - **Open contribution model**: contributor guidelines provided via
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

  - **Open content license**: material is released under [CC0
  1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), allowing reuse and
  adaptation.
