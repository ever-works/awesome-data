**Category:** Meta-directories  
**Tags:** meta-directory, graphics, awesome-lists

## Overview
Meta Awesome – OpenGL is a curated meta-list that aggregates “awesome” collections focused on OpenGL graphics programming. It serves as a starting point to discover specialized awesome-lists that cover libraries, tools, frameworks, and learning resources for OpenGL and related graphics development.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of OpenGL lists** – Indexes multiple awesome-lists dedicated to OpenGL and graphics programming rather than being a single resource list itself.
- **Focus on OpenGL ecosystem** – Targets OpenGL specifically, including modern OpenGL practices, legacy contexts, and cross-platform usage.
- **Coverage of tools and libraries** – Points to collections that include rendering engines, helper libraries, math libraries, shader toolchains, debuggers, and profilers.
- **Learning and educational resources** – Includes links to lists that group tutorials, guides, books, courses, and sample code for learning OpenGL.
- **Related graphics programming resources** – Extends beyond core OpenGL to related graphics APIs, pipelines, and utilities commonly used alongside OpenGL.
- **Part of the Meta Awesome project** – Integrated into the broader `meta-awesome` repository, which organizes meta-lists for many different domains, keeping structure and conventions consistent.

## Pricing
- Meta Awesome – OpenGL is a free, open GitHub resource. There are no pricing plans or paid tiers.
