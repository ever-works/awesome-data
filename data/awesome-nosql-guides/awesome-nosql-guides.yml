  # Awesome NoSQL Guides


  > Curated list of resources and links about using NoSQL databases and what to
  consider when deciding to use one.


  A community-maintained, "awesome"-style directory focused on practical
  learning resources for non-relational, distributed, open-source, and
  horizontally scalable NoSQL databases.


  ---


  ## Overview


  Awesome NoSQL Guides is a GitHub-based curated list that aggregates
  educational materials about:


  - How to use different types of NoSQL databases

  - Conceptual understanding of NoSQL vs relational databases

  - Design and architectural considerations when adopting NoSQL

  - Trade-offs and evaluation criteria when choosing a NoSQL solution


  It complements existing lists of actual database products by focusing
  specifically on learning and guidance resources.

  ## Features


  - **Curated learning resources**  
    Focuses on guides, tutorials, and educational material around NoSQL databases rather than the databases themselves.

  - **Usage-focused content**  
    Emphasizes how to *use* NoSQL databases in practice and what to watch for when designing systems around them.

  - **Decision-making guidance**  
    Includes resources covering criteria and considerations for when and why to use NoSQL, and how to compare with relational databases.

  - **Covers broad NoSQL concepts**  
    Oriented around non-relational data models, distributed architectures, and horizontally scalable database systems.

  - **External references to database lists**  
    Links out to other directories and rankings of actual NoSQL databases (e.g., awesome databases lists, DB-Engines, and similar resources) for users who also want to explore concrete products.

  - **Community-driven repository**  
    Hosted on GitHub, with standard open-source practices:
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines on how to add or update resources
    - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` defining community behavior expectations
    - `LICENSE` (CC0-1.0) indicating resources are curated into a public-domain-style list
