## Features

- **Curated café listings**  
  - Focus on cafés suitable for working (e.g., remote work, studying).  
  - Each entry is hand-picked and organized as part of an “awesome” list.

- **City-based GeoJSON datasets**  
  Repository contains multiple `.geojson` files, each representing café locations for a specific city in China, including but not limited to:
  - `baoding.geojson`
  - `beijing.geojson`
  - `changsha.geojson`
  - `chengdu.geojson`
  - `chongqing.geojson`
  - `dalian.geojson`
  - `foshan.geojson`
  - `guangzhou.geojson`
  - `guiyang.geojson`
  - `hangzhou.geojson`
  - (and additional city files visible in the repository’s file list)

- **Map-friendly data format**  
  - Uses GeoJSON for location data, making it easy to:
    - Visualize cafés on maps.
    - Integrate with mapping libraries or tools.

- **Open repository structure**  
  - `README.md` with project description and usage instructions (in the repo).  
  - `.editorconfig` for consistent code/text formatting.  
  - `.gitignore` for repository hygiene.  
  - `.github/workflows` for automation/CI related to data or repository maintenance.  
  - `resources/markers` folder for map marker resources (e.g., icons or related assets).  
  - `tools` folder for scripts/utilities to manage or process café/location data.

- **Awesome-list style catalog**  
  - Follows the convention of “awesome” lists on GitHub: curated, community-visible collection with standard awesome-list formatting in the README.
