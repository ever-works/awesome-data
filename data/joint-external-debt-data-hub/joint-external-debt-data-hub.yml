  ## Overview

  The Joint External Debt Hub (JEDH) is a joint data portal created by the Bank
  for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
  the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the
  World Bank (WB). It provides a unified view of external debt statistics and
  selected foreign assets, integrating information from international
  creditor/market sources and national debtor sources.


  ## Features

  - **Unified external debt portal**: Central access point for external debt
  statistics across countries and territories.

  - **Jointly developed by four major institutions**:
    - Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
    - International Monetary Fund (IMF)
    - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
    - World Bank Group (WB)
  - **Data coverage**:
    - External debt data
    - Selected foreign assets
    - Combines international creditor/market data with national debtor data (QEDS – Quarterly External Debt Statistics).
  - **Historical continuation**:
    - Replaces the "Joint BIS-IMF-OECD-WB Statistics on External Debt" website launched in 1999.
    - Continues and expands the role of providing international external debt statistics, originally focused on developing and transition countries and territories.
  - **Standardized units**:
    - Data generally provided in millions of US dollars, unless otherwise specified.
  - **Sovereign and external debt focus**:
    - Serves as a centralized hub for sovereign and external debt data used in economics and finance research.

  ## Data & Access
