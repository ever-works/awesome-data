## Overview

Awesome Research Tools is a structured collection of links to software and services that help researchers with productivity, collaboration, data management, and general research workflows. It is organized as a GitHub repository and follows the broader "awesome" list format, focusing on practical, research-relevant tools rather than marketing content.

The list emphasizes:
- Research productivity and organization
- Collaboration and version control
- Time and task management
- Cloud-based research workflows

## Features

### 1. Curated Research Tool Directory
- Maintained as a GitHub repository (`emptymalei/awesome-research`).
- Organized into topical sections (e.g., organization, cloud services).
- Designed to help with both research activities and broader academic life.
- Deprecated repo content is now mirrored and maintained via an external website front end (tools.kausalflow.com).

### 2. Be-Organized Section
A major part of the list focuses on staying organized as a researcher.

#### Version Control System (VCS)
- Introduces the concept and importance of VCS for researchers:
  - Tracking changes in documents, code, and manuscripts.
  - Enabling collaboration across teams and institutions.
- Highlights that version control is one of the most useful tools for scientists.
- Subcategories of VCS hosting solutions:
  - **Online Git Service** – hosted Git platforms (e.g., Git-based collaboration).
  - **Self-hosted Git Server** – deploy your own Git infrastructure.
  - **Enterprise Git Service** – organizational and corporate Git solutions.

#### Pomodoro Tools
- Focused on tools that implement the **Pomodoro Technique** to boost productivity and support healthier work patterns.
- Notes that there are many tool options, across platforms:
  - `Cloud`
  - `Mac`
  - `Win`
  - `Android`
  - `iOS`
  - `Chrome`
- Helps researchers structure work and rest periods for better focus.

#### GTD (Getting Things Done) Task Managers
- Introduces the **GTD methodology** for managing tasks and mental load:
  - Offloading todos to external systems.
  - Focusing on one active task rather than remembering all of them.
  - Organizing tasks by context (@home, @computer, @office, etc.), timing (now, next, scheduled, someday), and projects.
- Links to educational resources on GTD:
  - A pragmatic guide to GTD.
  - A GTD workflow chart.
- Lists GTD-style task tools across multiple platforms, highlighting cross-device availability:
  - `Cloud`
  - `Mac`
  - `Win`
  - `Android`
  - `iOS`
  - `Win Store`
  - `Chrome OS`
  - `Firefox`
- Emphasizes multi-platform task management suitable for researchers working across devices.

### 3. Cloud Services
- Includes a section for **Cloud Services** relevant to research workflows.
- Explicitly points to complementary resources for self-hosted alternatives:
  - References **awesome-selfhosted** (`https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted`) for users wanting to run their own infrastructure.

### 4. Community & Contribution Structure
- Contains a `contributing.md` file outlining how to contribute new tools or improvements to the list (community-driven curation).
- Hosted on GitHub with full commit history, enabling transparency and versioning of the directory itself.

## Pricing

- **Access:** Free.  
- The list itself is an open-source resource; it does not charge for access.
- Individual tools listed may have their own pricing models, but those are external to this directory and not defined within the list.

## Ideal Use Cases

- Researchers and students looking to improve their workflow, organization, and productivity.
- Labs or research groups standardizing on tools for version control, task management, and cloud workflows.
- Anyone in academia searching for a vetted starting point for research-relevant software and services.
