### Overview
Awesome Job Boards is a curated, open-source list of niche job boards focused on specific industries, roles, and communities. It serves as a directory that aggregates links to specialized job sites rather than providing its own job listings platform.

### Features
- **Curated list format**: Maintained as a GitHub repository using the community-driven "awesome list" pattern.
- **Focus on niche job boards**: Highlights boards that specialize in particular industries, roles, or communities (e.g., tech, design, remote work, underrepresented groups, etc. — where applicable in the list).
- **Link aggregation**: Provides direct links to external job boards; does not host jobs itself.
- **Organized structure**: Typically grouped by theme or category to make discovery easier (e.g., by industry, profession, or audience, as defined in the repo).
- **Open contribution model**: Users can propose additions or changes via GitHub (issues and pull requests), subject to the repository’s contribution guidelines.
- **Open-source licensing**: Distributed under the license specified in the GitHub repository (e.g., common OSS license noted in the repo).
- **Searchable via GitHub**: Can be searched, filtered, and version-controlled through GitHub’s interface.

### Pricing
- **Free**: The list is publicly accessible on GitHub at no cost. Individual job boards linked from the list may have their own pricing or usage terms, which are separate from this directory.
