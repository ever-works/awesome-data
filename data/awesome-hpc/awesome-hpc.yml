  # Awesome HPC


  **Website:** https://github.com/dstdev/awesome-hpc#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** awesome-lists, big-data, developer-tools


  ## Overview


  Awesome HPC is a curated, open-source directory of tools, libraries,
  documentation, and other resources related to High Performance Computing
  (HPC). It targets engineers and administrators who work with supercomputing,
  large-scale clusters, and performance-critical workloads in science,
  engineering, and business.


  ## Features


  ### Scope and Purpose

  - Curated list focused specifically on High Performance Computing (HPC).

  - Aimed at both engineers and system administrators working with clusters,
  supercomputers, and large-scale workloads.

  - Covers both open-source and proprietary tools.

  - Includes a broad range of software licenses (GPL, BSD, MIT, Apache, EPL,
  LGPL, proprietary, etc.).


  ### Main Categories of Resources


  - **Provisioning**  
    Tools and frameworks for installing, configuring, and managing HPC systems and clusters. Includes software across multiple licenses such as GPL-3, EPL-1.0, BSD-3, MIT, proprietary, and others.

  - **Workload Managers**  
    Job schedulers and workload management systems used to run and orchestrate jobs on HPC clusters. Includes both open-source (OSS, Apache-2.0, others) and proprietary options.

  - **Pipelines**  
    Workflow and pipeline tools for chaining and managing complex HPC workloads and data processing flows (Apache-2.0, BSD-3, and other licensed tools).

  - **Applications**  
    End-user HPC applications (e.g., domain-specific scientific, engineering, or data analysis apps) under licenses such as GPL-2 and others.

  - **Compilers**  
    HPC-focused compilers and toolchains, including both proprietary and open-source (e.g., GPL-3, OSS) options.

  - **MPI (Message Passing Interface)**  
    MPI implementations and related tooling for distributed-memory parallel programming, with BSD and other licenses represented.

  - **Parallel Computing**  
    Tools, libraries, or frameworks supporting parallel programming models beyond core MPI (e.g., shared-memory or hybrid approaches).

  - **Benchmarking**  
    Benchmarks and performance test suites for evaluating HPC systems, including tools under OSS, GPL-2, GPL-3, and other licenses.

  - **Miscellaneous**  
    HPC-related utilities and tools that don’t fit in other categories (MIT, LGPL-3, GPL-3, BSD-3, and other licenses).

  - **Performance**  
    Profiling, tuning, and performance analysis tools, covering both proprietary and open-source licenses (GPL-2 and others).

  - **Parallel Shells**  
    Shells and command-line tools designed to operate across many nodes in parallel (GPL-2, LGPL-2.1).

  - **Containers**  
    Container runtimes, orchestration, and tooling tailored to HPC environments, licensed under BSD, Apache-2.0, MPL 2.0, and others.

  - **Environment Management**  
    Tools to manage software environments and modules on HPC systems (GPL-2, BSD, and other licenses).

  - **Visualization**  
    Visualization tools relevant to HPC data and simulations (BSD-3 and similar licenses).

  - **Parallel Filesystems**  
    Parallel and distributed filesystems and related storage technologies, including proprietary and GPL-2.0-licensed systems.

  - **Programming Languages**  
    Programming languages and language ecosystems commonly used in HPC (MIT, ISC, Apache-2.0 licenses).

  - **Monitoring (Prometheus-based)**  
    Monitoring stacks and exporters built around Prometheus for observing HPC clusters and workloads, under GPL-3.0, Apache-2.0, and other licenses.

  ### Community and Documentation

  - Clearly defined **contribution guidelines** in `contributing.md` for adding
  or updating entries.

  - Additional documents like `developing.md` and `emerging.md` for project
  development practices and emerging HPC tools/topics.

  - Licensed repository with an explicit `LICENSE` file for the list itself.


  ## Pricing


  - Not applicable. Awesome HPC is an open, curated list hosted on GitHub and
  does not present pricing plans for access to the list itself.
