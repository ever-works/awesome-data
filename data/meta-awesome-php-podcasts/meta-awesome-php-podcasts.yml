  **Website:**
  <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/php-podcasts.md>

  **Category:** Meta Directories  

  **Brand:** GitHub


  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – PHP Podcasts is a meta-directory within the Meta Awesome
  project that indexes and links to "Awesome"-style lists and curated
  collections of PHP-related podcasts. Instead of cataloging individual shows,
  it centralizes references to existing community-maintained lists.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-directory scope** – focuses on aggregating links to other curated PHP
  podcast lists, not the podcasts themselves.

  - **Awesome-list compatible** – targets "Awesome"-style lists (e.g., GitHub
  awesome lists) and similar curated collections.

  - **PHP-specific focus** – dedicated to resources that cover PHP development,
  tooling, frameworks, and ecosystem topics.

  - **Community-driven sources** – relies on community-maintained repositories
  and lists hosted primarily on GitHub.

  - **Centralized discovery** – provides a single entry point to explore
  multiple independent PHP podcast collections.

  - **Markdown-based listing** – maintained as a markdown document in a GitHub
  repository, making it easy to browse, diff, and contribute.

  - **Part of Meta Awesome** – integrates with the wider Meta Awesome project,
  which organizes meta-lists for various technologies and topics.
