## Overview
Meta Awesome – PHP Podcasts is a meta-directory within the Meta Awesome project that indexes and links to "Awesome"-style lists and curated collections of PHP-related podcasts. Instead of cataloging individual shows, it centralizes references to existing community-maintained lists.

## Features
- **Meta-directory scope** – focuses on aggregating links to other curated PHP podcast lists, not the podcasts themselves.
- **Awesome-list compatible** – targets "Awesome"-style lists (e.g., GitHub awesome lists) and similar curated collections.
- **PHP-specific focus** – dedicated to resources that cover PHP development, tooling, frameworks, and ecosystem topics.
- **Community-driven sources** – relies on community-maintained repositories and lists hosted primarily on GitHub.
- **Centralized discovery** – provides a single entry point to explore multiple independent PHP podcast collections.
- **Markdown-based listing** – maintained as a markdown document in a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, diff, and contribute.
- **Part of Meta Awesome** – integrates with the wider Meta Awesome project, which organizes meta-lists for various technologies and topics.
