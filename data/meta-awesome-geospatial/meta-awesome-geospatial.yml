    Points to awesome lists about desktop GIS, web GIS, spatial databases, and related tooling.

  - **Mapping libraries and frameworks**  
    References collections covering mapping SDKs and libraries (e.g., web map libraries, mobile mapping, visualization frameworks).

  - **Language- and stack-agnostic**  
    Serves as an entry point to awesome lists for multiple programming languages and technology stacks used in geospatial work.

  - **Documentation-style format**  
    Hosted as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, easy to browse, search, and contribute to via pull requests.
