  # Awesome Cross-Platform Node.js


  **Website:** https://github.com/bcoe/awesome-cross-platform-nodejs#readme  

  **Creator / Brand:** bcoe  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** nodejs, cross-platform, developer-tools


  ## Overview

  Awesome Cross-Platform Node.js is a curated GitHub directory of tools,
  libraries, and reference resources focused on writing Node.js code that works
  reliably across different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux). It
  organizes links and examples around common Node.js APIs and cross-platform
  concerns, helping developers avoid OS-specific pitfalls.


  ## Features


  ### Curated Resource Collections

  - Focuses specifically on **cross-platform Node.js development**.

  - Organizes resources around core Node.js modules and APIs commonly involved
  in cross-platform issues:
    - `os`
    - `path`
    - `fs`
    - `process`
    - `child_process`
  - Highlights patterns, caveats, and tools that help ensure code behaves
  consistently across operating systems.


  ### Applications & Tooling

  - **Applications section** grouping tools by use case:
    - **Development environment** – tools and setups aimed at building a portable dev environment for Node.js.
    - **Continuous integration** – CI services, configs, or patterns that work reliably across platforms.
    - **Virtualization** – tools/approaches (e.g., VMs, containers) to emulate or standardize environments.
    - **Compatibility** – utilities such as `gcc` and related toolchains for compiling or building native modules across OSes.
    - **Databases** – database-related tools and libraries with cross-platform considerations.

  ### Libraries & API-Focused Notes

  - **OS identification**
    - Libraries and patterns for detecting the current operating system in Node.js.

  - **Shell / Process Execution**
    - Guidance and libraries around:
      - `child_process.execFile`
      - `child_process.exec`
      - `child_process.spawn()`
    - Focus on avoiding shell quirks and ensuring commands work consistently on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

  - **Environment & Path Utilities**
    - Tools such as `which` and related utilities for reliably locating executables across platforms.

  - **Filesystem Abstractions & Patterns**
    - Use and behavior of:
      - `mkdir -p`-style directory creation
      - `fs.readdir()`
      - Core `fs` module
      - `graceful-fs` for more resilient filesystem operations
      - Special paths like `/dev/null` and their cross-platform equivalents/limitations.

  - **Signals & Process Management**
    - Notes around signal handling such as `exit` and differences in behavior between operating systems.

  - **Streams & Special Devices**
    - Examples and guidance using streams like:
      - `fs.createReadStream('/dev/null')`
      - `fs.createReadStream('/dev/urandom')`
    - Considerations for availability and behavior on non-Unix platforms.

  - **Desktop UI**
    - Libraries and tools for building desktop user interfaces with Node.js in a cross-platform manner.

  - **Windows Registry**
    - Tools and libraries to interact with the Windows registry from Node.js while keeping code portable where possible.

  ### Known Issues & Pitfalls

  - Dedicated **Known issues** section documenting common cross-platform traps,
  including:
    - Behavior and quirks of `cmd.exe` on Windows.
    - Differences and edge cases when using:
      - `child_process.spawn()`
      - `child_process.exec()`
  - Helps developers anticipate and work around OS-specific problems.


  ### Community & Contribution Structure

  - Includes repository governance and meta files:
    - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community standards.
    - `contributing.md` with contribution guidelines.
    - `.editorconfig` for consistent code style across contributors.
    - `.all-contributorsrc` indicating use of the All Contributors specification.
  - Licensed via `LICENSE.md` (open-source license details provided in the repo
  file).


  ## Pricing

  - This is a free, open-source, GitHub-hosted curated list.
