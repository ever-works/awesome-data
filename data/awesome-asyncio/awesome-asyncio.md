## Description
Awesome Asyncio is a curated directory of Python asyncio frameworks, libraries, software, and learning resources. It focuses on tools and materials for asynchronous I/O in Python 3, built around the `asyncio` standard library module introduced in Python 3.4.

> Note: The repository is currently unmaintained and looking for a new maintainer.

## Features

### Scope and Focus
- Concentrates on Python’s `asyncio` ecosystem (coroutines, event loops, async I/O)
- Highlights libraries for single-threaded concurrent code and multiplexed I/O
- Targets Python 3, especially post–3.4 releases

### Library & Tool Categories
- **Web Frameworks**  
  Libraries and frameworks for building asynchronous web applications using asyncio.

- **Message Queues**  
  Asyncio-compatible libraries for building applications that communicate via message queues.

- **Database Drivers**  
  Async drivers and client libraries for connecting to databases using asyncio.

- **Networking**  
  Libraries for network communication (clients, servers, and related networking tools) built on asyncio.

- **GraphQL**  
  Libraries for building GraphQL servers with asyncio support, including:
  - `libgraphqlparser`

- **Testing**  
  Libraries, tools, and helpers for testing asyncio-based applications.

- **Alternative Loops**  
  Alternative implementations of the asyncio event loop that can be used as drop-in replacements or enhancements.

- **Miscellaneous**  
  Other asyncio-related utilities and helpers, including references such as:
  - `pathlib`
  - `run()`
  - `asyncio`

### Learning Resources
- **Writings**  
  Documentation, blog posts, and other written material explaining asyncio concepts and best practices.

- **Talks**  
  Recorded talks and presentations about asyncio and the async ecosystem in Python.
