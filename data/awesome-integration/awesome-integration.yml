  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** awesome-lists, integration, developer-tools


  ## Description

  Awesome Integration is a curated directory of software, patterns, and learning
  resources for IT system integration. It focuses on tools and approaches for
  connecting heterogeneous systems so they can work together as a cohesive
  whole.


  ## Features


  ### Scope

  - Curated list focused specifically on system integration and connecting
  disparate IT components.

  - Emphasis on practical tools, established patterns, and reference resources
  for integrators and developers.


  ### Project Categories

  Directory of integration-related software, grouped by domain:

  - **API Management** – Platforms for managing the full API lifecycle
  (creation, publishing, securing, monitoring, analytics, rate limiting,
  authentication, etc.). Example entries include:
    - Akana API Management Platform
    - Amazon API Management (AWS)
    - Anypoint Platform (MuleSoft)
    - Amplify API Management Platform (Axway)
    - Apigee (Google Cloud)
  - **API Design** – Tools and platforms to model, design, and specify APIs.

  - **API Documentation** – Solutions for generating and publishing API docs.

  - **API Gateway** – Gateways that handle routing, security, and policies for
  API calls.

  - **API Testing** – Tools for validating, testing, and automating API quality
  checks.

  - **Business Rules Engine** – Engines for defining and executing business
  rules separately from application code.

  - **Business Process Management (BPM)** – Suites and engines to model,
  orchestrate, and monitor business processes.

  - **Change Data Capture (CDC)** – Tools that capture and propagate data
  changes between systems.

  - **Data Integration** – Platforms and tools for moving, transforming, and
  synchronizing data across systems.

  - **Data Mapping Solution** – Tools for mapping between different data
  structures and schemas.

  - **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)** – ESB platforms for message routing,
  transformation, and mediation.

  - **Integration Frameworks** – Libraries and frameworks for building custom
  integration solutions.

  - **Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS)** – Cloud-based integration
  platforms connecting SaaS/on-prem systems.

  - **Messaging as a Service** – Cloud messaging platforms offering pub/sub,
  queues, and event streaming.

  - **Managed File Transfer (MFT)** – Tools for secure, auditable file-based
  integrations.

  - **Master Data Management (MDM)** – Solutions for managing and synchronizing
  master data across applications.

  - **Message Broker** – Brokers for asynchronous messaging and event-driven
  integration.

  - **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** – Tools to automate UI and repetitive
  tasks for integration with legacy or third‑party systems.

  - **Self-Service Integration** – Low-code / no-code tools enabling
  non-developers to create integrations.

  - **Workflow Engine** – Engines for defining and executing workflows involving
  multiple systems.


  ### Pattern Collections

  Curated references to architectural and design patterns relevant to
  integration:

  - **Enterprise Integration Patterns** – Messaging and integration patterns for
  connecting enterprise systems.

  - **Integration Architecture Patterns** – High-level architectural approaches
  for system integration.

  - **Microservice API Patterns** – Patterns specific to microservice APIs and
  their interactions.

  - **SOA Patterns** – Patterns for service-oriented architectures.


  ### Resource Categories

  Additional learning and reference materials:

  - **API Specification** – Standards and formats for describing APIs.

  - **Articles** – Written resources covering integration techniques, tooling,
  and best practices.

  - **Certifications** – Integration-related certification programs.

  - **Connectors** – Libraries and adapters for connecting to specific systems
  and services.

  - **Data Formats** – Commonly used data representation formats in integration
  scenarios.

  - **Integration Styles** – Conceptual approaches and styles for integrating
  systems.

  - **Market Analysis** – Reports and analyses of the integration tools and
  platforms landscape.

  - **Protocols** – Communication protocols commonly used in integration
  solutions.

  - **Standard APIs** – Widely adopted APIs serving as de facto standards in
  certain domains.

  - **Structure and Validation** – Standards and tools for data structures,
  schemas, and validation.


  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. This is a free, open curated list (GitHub repository) rather
  than a commercial product or service.
