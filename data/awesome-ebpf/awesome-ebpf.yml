  ## Description

  Awesome eBPF is a curated, community-driven list of projects and resources
  related to extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF). It focuses on tools,
  libraries, and references for low-level packet processing, tracing,
  monitoring, security, and extending Linux kernel capabilities.


  ## Features

  - **Curated project directory**
    - Maintains a structured list of “awesome” eBPF-related projects.
    - Focuses on high-signal resources for working with eBPF in the Linux ecosystem.

  - **Coverage across the eBPF ecosystem**
    - Includes projects for:
      - Low-level packet processing (e.g., XDP)
      - System tracing and observability
      - Monitoring system events and performance
      - Access control and security (e.g., over cgroups)
    - Highlights tools that leverage eBPF’s performance, programmability, and flexibility.

  - **Educational context on eBPF**
    - Explains the evolution from classic BPF (cBPF) to extended BPF (eBPF).
    - Describes core eBPF capabilities such as:
      - In-kernel virtual machine for user-space–supplied programs
      - Safety and termination checks
      - JIT compilation for eBPF programs
      - Persistent maps and a standard library
      - Hardware offload support

  - **Reference to broader ecosystem resources**
    - Links to external eBPF learning and project directories, such as:
      - ebpf.io for introductory material
      - ebpf.io/projects for related project listings.

  - **Open contribution model**
    - Public GitHub repository structure with:
      - `readme.md` for the main awesome list
      - `contributing.md` for contribution guidelines
      - `code-of-conduct.md` for community conduct rules
      - `CODEOWNERS` defining maintainers
    - Encourages the community to help keep the list current and improve its signal-to-noise ratio.

  - **Licensing and repository metadata**
    - Includes a `LICENSE` file specifying usage terms for the list.
    - Standard project files (`package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `.gitattributes`) to support repository tooling and maintenance.

  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. Awesome eBPF is an open, public GitHub repository and
  resource list with no pricing or paid plans indicated.
