  # ASLAN Challenge


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Type:** Video action similarity dataset and benchmark  

  **Brand:** Open University of Israel  

  **Source:** <http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/data/ASLAN/ASLAN.html>


  ## Overview


  The Action Similarity Labeling (ASLAN) Challenge is a video database and
  benchmark designed to study action similarity in unconstrained videos. It
  provides a labeled dataset of action samples and a full testing protocol for
  evaluating methods that determine whether two video clips contain the same
  action.


  ## Features


  - **Dataset Composition**
    - 3,697 action samples
    - 1,571 unique YouTube video URLs
    - 432 action classes (non-trivial categories)
    - 316 classes with more than one sample
    - Average of 8.5 samples per class
    - Largest class: **“Handstand”** with 91 samples from 64 URLs
    - 71 long samples (duration > 10 seconds)
    - 187 short samples (duration < 1 second)

  - **Action Samples**
    - Each sample is a sub-sequence of a shot from a single camera
    - Each sample contains one detected action in a consecutive set of frames
    - Manually labeled with the name of the action being performed

  - **Benchmark Protocol**
    - Binary pair matching task: decide if two videos present the **same** or **not-same** action
    - Training uses labeled video pairs (same / not-same)
    - Action classes present in the test set are **not** included in training
      - Prevents building explicit action models for test actions during training
      - Encourages generalization to unseen actions

  - **Provided Resources**
    - Full ASLAN video database
    - Public benchmark protocols for evaluation
    - Descriptor encodings of action samples using state-of-the-art methods (at time of creation)

  - **Research Use and Access**
    - Intended for video understanding and action similarity research
    - Dataset and related materials are made publicly available for the research community
    - Use is subject to original copyright holders’ terms; redistribution may require explicit permission

  - **Related Event**
    - Associated with the 1st IEEE International Workshop on Action Similarity in Unconstrained Videos (ACTS'13), held with CVPR 2013, which used ASLAN as a performance competition benchmark.
