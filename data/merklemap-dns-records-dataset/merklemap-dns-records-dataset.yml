  ## Overview


  The Merklemap DNS Records Dataset is a large-scale DNS (Domain Name System)
  records database containing more than 4 billion records across hundreds of
  millions of domains. It is intended for Internet measurement, cybersecurity,
  DNS research, and data enrichment, and is provided in a JSON/JSONL format
  suitable for large-scale analysis.


  ## Features


  - **Scale & Coverage**
    - Over 4 billion DNS records.
    - Coverage across a very large number of domains (hundreds of millions).
    - Provides a broad, global view of DNS infrastructure and activity.

  - **Record Types**
    - Includes common DNS record types:
      - A
      - AAAA
      - CNAME
      - MX
      - NS
      - TXT
    - May include additional DNS record types beyond those listed.

  - **Data Format**
    - Delivered as `dns_records.jsonl` (JSON Lines format).
    - Each line contains a JSON object with at least:
      - `hostname`: the queried domain/hostname, e.g. `"example.com"`.
      - `results`: array of query result objects, including:
        - `success.query`: DNS query string (e.g. `"example.com IN A"`).
        - `success.query_timestamp`: timestamp of the DNS query (RFC3339 / ISO-like format).
        - `success.records`: object mapping record type to values, e.g.:
          - `A: ["192.0.2.1", "192.0.2.2"]`
    - Optimized for integration with analysis pipelines and tooling.

  - **File Size & Distribution**
    - Compressed size: **41 GiB**.
    - Uncompressed size: **417.6 GiB**.

  - **Intended Use Cases**
    - **Cybersecurity Research**
      - Identify potentially malicious domains and suspicious IP addresses.
      - Study DNS-based attack infrastructure and threat campaigns.
    - **Threat Hunting**
      - Search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) across large DNS datasets.
      - Surface hidden or emerging threats through DNS patterns.
    - **Network Troubleshooting**
      - Investigate DNS-related issues.
      - Analyze misconfigurations or resolution failures.
    - **Domain & Infrastructure Intelligence**
      - Examine domain ownership and hosting infrastructure.
      - Map relationships among domains, IPs, and name servers.
      - Support competitive analysis and market research.
    - **Brand Protection**
      - Monitor DNS records for phishing, typosquatting, or brand misuse.
    - **Data Enrichment**
      - Augment existing security, network, or business datasets with DNS context.
