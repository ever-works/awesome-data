  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Databases is an “awesome-style” meta-directory that aggregates

  to separate awesome lists and related resources covering different types of
  databases, their ecosystems, and associated tools.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-aggregation of awesome lists**
    - Collects multiple database-related awesome lists into a single entry point.
    - Focuses on broader database topics rather than a single technology.

  - **Coverage of different kinds of databases**
    - Includes resources for various database paradigms (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, specialized databases) as provided by the underlying awesome lists.
    - Surfaces tools and ecosystems that sit around core database engines.

  - **Ecosystem and tooling focus**
    - Links to tools that support database development, operations, and management (e.g., ORMs, migration tools, admin GUIs, performance tools), according to the referenced lists.
    - Helps developers discover related utilities and surrounding infrastructure for databases.

  - **Developer-oriented directory**
    - Curated with developers in mind, emphasizing practical resources, tools, and knowledge.
    - Uses the familiar “awesome list” format for consistency and ease of navigation.

  - **Part of a broader meta-awesome collection**
    - Lives within the larger `meta-awesome` project, which organizes awesome lists across many domains, making it easier to jump between database topics and other technical areas.
