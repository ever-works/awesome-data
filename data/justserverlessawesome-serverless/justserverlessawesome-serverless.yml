  ## Overview


  `awesome-serverless` is a (now deprecated) GitHub-hosted, awesome-style
  curated directory of resources related to serverless computing and serverless
  architectures. It aggregates links and references to tools, learning
  materials, and community content across the broader serverless ecosystem.


  ## Features


  - **Curated serverless resource list**  
    - Focuses on “all things serverless,” including architectures, platforms, and tooling.  
    - Inspired by the general [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list format and conventions.

  - **Organized by content type** (as indicated by the table of contents):  
    - **General** – Introductory and high-level resources about serverless computing and architectures.  
    - **Blogs** – Ongoing blogs dedicated to serverless topics and ecosystem updates.  
    - **Blog posts** – Individual articles or deep-dives on specific serverless concepts, patterns, or case studies.  
    - **Screencasts** – Video tutorials and hands-on demonstrations for learning serverless development and deployment.  
    - **Talks** – Conference talks, meetups, and presentations about serverless best practices and real-world usage.  
    - **Projects** – Open-source or reference projects that showcase serverless implementations and examples.  
    - **Related projects** – Other curated lists or repositories that are adjacent to or complement serverless topics.  
    - **Serverless Framework Plugins** – Plugins specifically built for the Serverless Framework to extend functionality (e.g., deployment workflows, environment handling like `.env`, integrations).  
    - **Literature / Education** – Books, courses, and other structured learning materials on serverless computing.  
    - **Professional services** – Service providers and consultancies that offer expertise around serverless adoption and implementation.

  - **GitHub-native structure**  
    - **README-based index**: Main list content is maintained in `README.md`.  
    - **Contributing guidelines**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` describes how to propose additions or changes to the list.  
    - **Archive notice**: `ARCHIVE.md` documents the deprecation/archival status and context.  
    - **Open-source license**: A `LICENSE` file governs how the list content can be used and shared.

  - **Community-driven curation**  
    - Hosted on GitHub with contributions from multiple collaborators (contributors listed via GitHub’s contributor graph).  
    - Uses issues and pull requests to evolve and maintain the resource directory.

  - **Deprecation / Archive status**  
    - Explicitly marked as **DEPRECATED** and archived.  
    - Still useful as a historical snapshot and reference for serverless resources, but not actively maintained.

  ## Licensing


  - Distributed with an explicit `LICENSE` file in the repository.  

  - Use and redistribution are governed by that open-source license (see the
  repository’s `LICENSE` file for details).


  ## Pricing


  - Not applicable. This is an open-source, GitHub-hosted curated list with no
  pricing plans mentioned.
