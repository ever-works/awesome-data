  ## Overview


  Awesome Android is an open, curated directory of Android libraries, packages,
  and development resources. It aggregates community-maintained links to tools,
  frameworks, and reference material for building Android applications.


  ## Features


  - **Curated Android library index**  
    - Lists Android-specific packages and libraries across many domains (UI, networking, persistence, testing, etc.).  
    - Focuses on tools directly relevant to Android app development.

  - **Resources collection**  
    - Links to learning materials and other resources for Android developers.  
    - Suggests complementary lists for broader ecosystems, such as a separate *awesome-java* list for general Java libraries.

  - **Community-driven repository**  
    - Hosted on GitHub as a public repository.  
    - Contributors can propose additions and improvements via standard GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests).  
    - Includes contribution guidelines (`contributing.md`).

  - **Open licensing**  
    - Licensed under the CC0-1.0 license, allowing broad reuse of the list contents.

  - **Ecosystem discoverability**  
    - Helps developers discover libraries and tools for common Android development tasks.  
    - Centralized entry point instead of searching disparate sources.

  ## Licensing


  - **License:** CC0-1.0


  ## Pricing


  - Access to the Awesome Android list is free and open-source; no pricing or
  paid plans are associated with the directory itself.
