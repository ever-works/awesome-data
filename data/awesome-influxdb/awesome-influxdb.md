## Overview

Awesome InfluxDB is an open, crowdsourced “awesome list” that organizes the InfluxDB ecosystem into clear categories. It helps developers, operators, and data engineers discover client libraries, data collection tools, visualization dashboards, provisioning utilities, hosting options, and reference material related to InfluxDB.

## Features

### Curated ecosystem directory
- Focuses on InfluxDB (version 1.0 and later).
- Organizes the ecosystem into logical sections for easier discovery.
- Accepts community contributions via pull requests.

### Reference material
- Section for external educational resources:
  - Blog posts
  - Conference talks
  - Slide decks
  - Other learning material related to InfluxDB

### Client libraries
- Catalog of libraries used to interact with InfluxDB from applications.
- Split into:
  - **Official client libraries** (maintained by the InfluxDB team).
  - **Unofficial client libraries** (community-maintained or third‑party).

### Collecting data into InfluxDB
Comprehensive list of options for ingesting data into InfluxDB:

- **Projects**
  - **Dedicated tools**
    - Tools whose primary or sole purpose is to send data to InfluxDB.
  - **Non‑dedicated tools**
    - General telemetry/metrics/logging tools that can output to multiple backends, including InfluxDB.

- **Libraries**
  - Libraries that help applications collect metrics or events and write them into InfluxDB.

- **Hooks**
  - Integrations that connect existing logging libraries to InfluxDB output.

- **Plugins**
  - Plugins for third‑party/standalone tools enabling them to send their data to InfluxDB.

- **Import tools**
  - Utilities for importing fixed or historical datasets into InfluxDB.

### Consuming data from InfluxDB
Tools that help query, analyze, or display data stored in InfluxDB:

- **Dashboards and visualization**
  - Dashboard frameworks and visualization tools that can read from InfluxDB.

- **Other tools**
  - Additional utilities for querying, analyzing, or otherwise using data from InfluxDB.

### Provisioning InfluxDB
- Tools and libraries that simplify deploying and managing InfluxDB instances, such as:
  - Automation/provisioning scripts
  - Configuration helpers
  - Orchestration integrations

### Queries
- Section dedicated to InfluxDB query examples, helpers, or query‑related utilities.

### Hosting / SaaS
- Directory of services and platforms offering hosted InfluxDB or SaaS-style InfluxDB solutions.

### Miscellaneous
- Catch‑all category for InfluxDB‑related projects that do not fit other sections (e.g., utilities, helpers, experiments).

### Other awesome lists
- **Awesome lists that include InfluxDB links**
  - Pointers to other ecosystem lists that mention or integrate InfluxDB.
- **Meta awesome lists**
  - Lists of awesome lists that reference awesome‑influxdb itself.

### Open contribution model
- Contributions are guided via a dedicated `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- New resources are added through GitHub pull requests.

### Licensing
- Published under the **CC0 (Public Domain)** license.
