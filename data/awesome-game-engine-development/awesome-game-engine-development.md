## Overview
Awesome Game Engine Development is a curated directory of resources focused on building high-level, fully featured game engines (similar in scope to engines like Godot or Unity). It emphasizes tools and materials that go beyond low-level frameworks or graphics libraries, covering complete engine systems and the topics needed to design and implement them.

## Features
- **Focused on full game engines**
  - Emphasis on high-level, fully featured game engines rather than low-level libraries or simple frameworks.
  - Includes engines and resources that provide systems such as:
    - Visual scene editors
    - Scripting support
    - Physics
    - Asset management
    - Special effects
    - Monetization-related capabilities

- **Game Engines Section**
  - Collection of production-ready engines that can be explored, studied, and used for inspiration.
  - Subsections for organizing engines by type or status:
    - Awesome Collections
    - Popular
    - AAA
    - Commercial
    - Specialty

- **Learning Resources**
  - Materials covering topics important for game engine design and implementation, including:
    - Computer Graphics
    - Engine Development
    - Game Development
    - Graphical User Interface
    - Programming

- **Libraries and Frameworks by Language**
  - Language-specific libraries, frameworks, or code useful for engine development.
  - Organized by programming language, including (as listed):
    - BASIC
    - C
    - C++
    - C#
    - Dart
    - F#
    - Go
    - Haxe
    - Lua
    - Java
    - JavaScript
    - Kotlin
    - Pascal
    - Python
    - Ruby (truncated in source but implied)

- **Repository Structure and Contribution**
  - Public GitHub repository with:
    - `README.md` as the main index of resources.
    - `ARCHIVE.md` for archived or older items.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines on adding or updating entries.
    - `LICENSE` specifying usage terms.

## Use Cases
- Discovering existing game engines to study architecture and design.
- Finding reference materials on graphics, engine architecture, GUIs, and game development.
- Locating language-specific engine-related libraries for various programming languages.
- Using curated links as a starting point for building a custom game engine.

## Pricing
- Not a commercial product or service.
- Public GitHub list available to browse for free (subject to GitHub’s standard terms and the repository’s license).
