  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Languages is an Awesome-style index within the broader Meta
  Awesome project that catalogs programming languages and language-related
  resources. It aggregates and organizes links to curated “awesome” lists and
  reference materials focused on programming languages, helping users discover
  high-quality language ecosystems and learning resources.


  ## Features

  - **Awesome-style index:** Follows the familiar Awesome list convention
  (curated links, structured sections, concise descriptions).

  - **Programming language focus:** Dedicated specifically to programming
  languages and language-related tools/resources.

  - **Part of Meta Awesome catalog:** Integrated into a larger meta-directory
  that indexes many Awesome lists, providing cross-linking and consistency.

  - **Language-related resources:** Includes references not only to languages
  themselves, but also to related tooling, libraries, and learning materials
  (where covered by the underlying lists).

  - **GitHub-hosted:** Maintained as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository,
  allowing community contributions via pull requests and issues.

  - **Human-readable Markdown:** Simple, text-based format suitable for reading
  directly on GitHub or reusing in other documentation contexts.


  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. This is a free, open, GitHub-hosted index of resources.
