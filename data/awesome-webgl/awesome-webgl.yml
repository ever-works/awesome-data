  ## Overview


  Awesome WebGL is a curated, community-maintained list of WebGL-related
  libraries, tools, and learning resources. It focuses on technologies for
  building 2D and 3D graphics in the browser using the WebGL JavaScript API.


  ## What is WebGL


  - WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive
  2D and 3D graphics in compatible web browsers without plug-ins.

  - It is integrated into web standards, enabling GPU-accelerated physics, image
  processing, and visual effects via the HTML canvas.

  - WebGL content can be combined with regular HTML elements and composed with
  the rest of the page.

  - WebGL programs consist of:
    - Control logic written in JavaScript.
    - Shader programs executed on the GPU, written in GLSL (OpenGL ES Shading Language).

  ## Features


  - **Curated WebGL Ecosystem List**
    - Organized collection of WebGL libraries, tools, and resources.
    - Focuses on both 2D and 3D browser graphics using WebGL.

  - **Structured Contents (by Topic)**

    - **Bug Reporting**
      - Resources and links related to reporting WebGL-related bugs.
    - **GLSL Editors**
      - Online editors for writing and experimenting with GLSL shaders.

  - **Standards & Specification References**
    - Notes that WebGL shader code must conform to **The OpenGL ES Shading Language, Version 1.00**.
    - Links to:
      - Official GLSL ES 1.00 specification PDF.
      - Related OpenGL ES specification resources.

  - **Repository Support Files**
    - `README.md` with the main curated list.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing contribution guidelines.
    - `code-of-conduct.md` defining community behavior expectations.
    - `LICENSE` file specifying open-source licensing.
    - CI configuration (`.travis.yml`) used for repository checks.

  ## Pricing
