## Overview
Meta Awesome – PHP Books is an "awesome-style" meta collection that aggregates curated lists of PHP books and book‑centric resources. Instead of listing individual PHP books, it points to other well‑maintained lists and directories focused on PHP learning materials.

## Features
- **Meta-collection format** – Acts as a hub that links out to multiple curated lists rather than duplicating their content.
- **Focus on PHP books** – Specializes in resources that are primarily book-based or book-centric for PHP developers.
- **Curated list aggregation** – Collects and organizes community-maintained lists of PHP books from various sources.
- **Awesome-list style** – Follows the common "awesome list" conventions (structured sections, concise descriptions, links to external resources).
- **Resource discovery** – Helps users discover new and existing PHP book lists in one place, reducing the need to search across the web.
- **Evolving directory** – Can be updated over time as new PHP book lists or resources are created and discovered.

## Use Cases
- Finding collections of PHP books for self-study or structured learning.
- Quickly exploring alternative curated PHP reading lists maintained by different authors.
- Building or updating your own PHP learning roadmap using multiple external book lists.
