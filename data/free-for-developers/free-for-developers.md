# Free for Developers

**Website:** https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev#readme  
**Category:** Themed Directories  
**Tags:** SaaS, developer-resources, free-tier

## Overview
Free for Developers is a community-maintained directory of online services (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and related offerings) that provide genuinely free tiers aimed at developers and infrastructure engineers. It functions as an “awesome list” specifically focused on as-a-Service products that can be used long-term without payment.

The list is curated with contributions from 1600+ people via GitHub pull requests.

## Scope and Curation Criteria
- Focuses on services useful to infrastructure-oriented roles:
  - System administrators
  - DevOps and platform engineers
  - Other infrastructure developers
- Only includes **as-a-Service** offerings (no self-hosted software).
- A service must have a **free tier**, not just a short-term free trial.
- Time-limited free tiers must be free for **at least one year** to be listed.
- Security-related requirement: free tiers must not restrict basic TLS to paid plans; SSO support on free tiers is acceptable.
- The list is opinionated; maintainers may decline entries that fall outside the intended scope.

- No paid tiers or plans mentioned for the directory itself.

(Individual services listed in the directory each have their own pricing and free-tier details, which are documented per entry in the GitHub repository, not centrally summarized here.)
