## Overview
Vert.x Awesome is a curated, community-maintained list of frameworks, libraries, tools, and learning resources related to Eclipse Vert.x for building reactive applications on the JVM. It organizes the Vert.x ecosystem into thematic categories, including official Vert.x stack components and third‑party integrations.

## Features

### General
- Curated list of Vert.x-related components and resources.
- Includes both official Vert.x stack modules and third‑party projects.
- Official Vert.x stack items are marked with a special stack icon to distinguish them from other entries.
- Contributions are accepted via pull requests to the GitHub repository.

### Resource Categories
The list is organized into multiple sections to simplify discovery:

- **Books**
  - Links to books focused on Vert.x and reactive microservices, such as:
    - *Building Reactive Microservices in Java* by Clément Escoffier.
    - *Vert.x in Action* by Julien Ponge.

- **Build Tools**
  - Vert.x Maven plugin.
  - Vert.x Gradle plugin.
  - Vert.x Codegen Gradle plugin for simplifying Vert.x Java code generation usage.

- **Web Frameworks**
  - **Vert.x Web** (official Vert.x stack) – full-featured web toolkit for Vert.x.
  - Vert.x Jersey – use JAX-RS (Jersey) resources within Vert.x.
  - Kovert – REST framework for Kotlin built on Vert.x Web.
  - Handlers – open web framework for Vert.x.
  - QBit – REST and WebSocket method-call marshaling plus reactive library.
  - vertx-rest-storage – persistence support for REST resources (partial description in source, but listed as a web-related storage component).

- **Additional Sections (Structure)**
  The README defines the following additional categories (each containing multiple libraries/tools and examples in the full list):
  - Authentication & Authorisation
  - Database Clients
  - Integration
  - Middleware
  - Language Support
  - Reactive
  - Sync Thread Non Block
  - Vert.x Event Bus Clients
  - Vert.x Event Bus Extensions
  - Cluster Managers
  - Cloud Support
  - Microservices
  - Search Engines
  - Service Factory
  - Config
  - Dependency Injection
  - Testing
  - Development Tools
  - Miscellaneous
  - Distribution
  - Examples
  - Deployment
  - Utilities
  - Articles
  - Front-End

These sections collectively provide a broad map of the Vert.x ecosystem: from core runtime integrations (cluster managers, cloud, microservices) to development-time utilities (testing, DI, build tools) and learning materials (books, articles, examples).

## Notes
- The maintainers explicitly state that they do not guarantee the stability or production readiness of every listed component unless it is marked as part of the official Vert.x stack via the stack icon.

## Pricing
- Not applicable. Vert.x Awesome is an open, GitHub-hosted curated list and does not expose pricing or paid plans.
