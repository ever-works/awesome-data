  # Meta Awesome – Distributed Databases

  **Category:** Meta Directories  
  **Slug:** meta-awesome-distributed-databases  
  **Website:** <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/distributed-databases.md>

  ## Overview
  Meta Awesome – Distributed Databases is a specialized meta-directory that indexes and organizes “awesome lists” focused on distributed databases and related large-scale data concepts. It aggregates curated resources about replication, sharding, and high-scale data storage systems into a single, structured reference.

  ## Features
  - **Meta index of awesome lists**
    - Collects and references multiple “awesome” lists specifically related to distributed databases.
    - Serves as a hub to discover domain-focused curated lists rather than raw projects.

  - **Distributed databases focus**
    - Centers on systems designed for distribution across multiple nodes or data centers.
    - Covers architectures used for high availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scaling.

  - **Replication resources**
    - Indexes lists that discuss data replication strategies and patterns.
    - Includes materials on consistency models, failover strategies, and multi-region replication.

  - **Sharding and partitioning**
    - References resources focused on sharding data across multiple nodes.
    - Covers topics such as partitioning strategies, routing, and rebalancing.

  - **Large-scale data storage systems**
    - Aggregates lists covering large-scale storage engines and distributed file or object stores.
    - Includes systems and patterns used in big-data and high-traffic environments.

  - **Centralized entry point**
    - Provides a single page to locate diverse distributed-database-related awesome lists.
    - Helps reduce duplication of search effort across GitHub and other sources.

  - **Open GitHub-based format**
    - Hosted as a markdown document within the `meta-awesome` GitHub repository.
    - Can be browsed, cloned, or extended via standard GitHub workflows.
