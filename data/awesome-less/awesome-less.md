## Overview
Awesome Less is a curated, community-maintained directory of frameworks, libraries, style guides, articles, and other resources related to the Less CSS preprocessor. Its goal is to centralize information about Less and keep it up to date for developers.

## What is Less?
Less is an open‑source dynamic stylesheet language that compiles to CSS and can run on the client side (in the browser) or server side. It provides:
- Variables
- Nesting
- Mixins
- Operators
- Functions

A key distinction from some other CSS preprocessors is support for real-time compilation in the browser via Less.js.
