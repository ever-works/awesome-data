## Overview
Awesome DevSecOps is an open, curated directory of learning resources and tools focused on integrating security practices into DevOps workflows (DevSecOps). It aggregates links to educational material, community hubs, and practical tooling that help bring security into the software development lifecycle.

DevSecOps is described as an extension of DevOps that embeds security into the development lifecycle through developer-centric security tooling and processes.

## Features

### 1. Curated Resource Directory
A structured collection of DevSecOps-related learning and reference material, including:
- **Articles** – written resources explaining DevSecOps concepts, practices, and implementation patterns.
- **Books** – longer-form references and guides for deeper study of security in DevOps environments.
- **Communities** – links to groups, forums, and social spaces where DevSecOps practitioners share knowledge.
- **Conferences** – events focused on or including DevSecOps, application security, and secure software delivery.
- **Newsletters** – regular updates and curated news on DevSecOps, AppSec, and related topics.
- **Podcasts** – audio content discussing DevSecOps trends, techniques, and case studies.
- **Secure Development Guidelines** – documented best practices and recommendations for writing secure code.
- **Secure Development Lifecycle Framework** – references to frameworks that structure security activities across the software lifecycle.
- **Toolchains** – examples and references for integrating multiple tools to create end‑to‑end DevSecOps pipelines.
- **Training** – courses and educational programs to build DevSecOps skills.
- **Wikis** – knowledge bases and documentation hubs covering DevSecOps and security topics.

### 2. Tooling Directory
A categorized list of tools used to implement DevSecOps practices, including (as shown in the available content):

- **Dependency Management**  
  Tools that:
  - Detect vulnerabilities in open source and third‑party packages.
  - Identify packages with known security issues.
  - Help update or remediate vulnerable dependencies.

- **Dynamic Analysis (DAST)**  
  Tools that:
  - Perform black-box security testing against running applications.
  - Emulate malicious activity to uncover common vulnerabilities.
  - Help find issues such as:
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
    - SQL injection
    - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    - Information disclosure and similar runtime flaws.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Analysis**  
  (Section introduced; focuses on analyzing IaC definitions for misconfigurations and security issues. Full list of tools is maintained in the repository.)

> Note: The repository likely includes additional tool categories beyond those visible in the provided excerpt (e.g., SAST, container scanning, secrets detection). These are organized in the README and associated sections.

### 3. Community Contributions
- **Open contribution model** – contributions are explicitly welcomed via:
  - Pull requests to add or improve links and entries.
  - Issues to propose discussions or changes.
- **Contribution guidelines** – documented in `contributing.md` to keep the list consistent and high quality.
- **Code of conduct** – documented in `code-of-conduct.md` to define expected community behavior.

### 4. Open Source & Licensing
- The repository includes a `license` file specifying terms for use and contribution (standard for “awesome” lists; details in the repo).

## Pricing
- Not applicable. Awesome DevSecOps is a public, open-source curated list and directory of resources and tools, accessible freely via GitHub.
