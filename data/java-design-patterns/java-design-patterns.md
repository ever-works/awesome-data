## Overview
`java-design-patterns` is a GitHub repository that implements a wide range of classic software design patterns in Java. It serves as a reusable reference collection and learning resource for understanding, practicing, and applying design patterns in real-world Java applications.

## Features
- **Comprehensive pattern coverage**  
  - Includes many classic design patterns, each in its own module/directory (e.g., `abstract-document`, `abstract-factory`, `active-object`, `actor-model`, `acyclic-visitor`, `adapter`, `ambassador`, `anti-corruption-layer`, `arrange-act-assert`, `async-method-invocation`, `backpressure`, `balking`, `bloc`, `bridge`, and more).
- **Java-based implementations**  
  - All patterns are implemented in Java, suitable for JVM-based application developers and learners.
- **Organized code structure**  
  - Each pattern is contained in a dedicated folder with source code, making it easy to explore and study patterns individually.
- **Reusable reference collection**  
  - Designed as a snippets/awesome-style collection that can be consulted when designing or refactoring software.
- **Educational focus**  
  - Demonstrates how patterns can be realized in Java to support learning of both the concepts and their practical implementation.
- **Version-controlled repository**  
  - Public GitHub repo with a long commit history (~4,000+ commits), allowing users to browse changes and contributions over time.

## Licensing
