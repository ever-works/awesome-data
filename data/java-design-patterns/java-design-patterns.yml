  ## Overview

  `java-design-patterns` is a GitHub repository that implements a wide range of
  classic software design patterns in Java. It serves as a reusable reference
  collection and learning resource for understanding, practicing, and applying
  design patterns in real-world Java applications.


  ## Features

  - **Comprehensive pattern coverage**  
    - Includes many classic design patterns, each in its own module/directory (e.g., `abstract-document`, `abstract-factory`, `active-object`, `actor-model`, `acyclic-visitor`, `adapter`, `ambassador`, `anti-corruption-layer`, `arrange-act-assert`, `async-method-invocation`, `backpressure`, `balking`, `bloc`, `bridge`, and more).
  - **Java-based implementations**  
    - All patterns are implemented in Java, suitable for JVM-based application developers and learners.
  - **Organized code structure**  
    - Each pattern is contained in a dedicated folder with source code, making it easy to explore and study patterns individually.
  - **Reusable reference collection**  
    - Designed as a snippets/awesome-style collection that can be consulted when designing or refactoring software.
  - **Educational focus**  
    - Demonstrates how patterns can be realized in Java to support learning of both the concepts and their practical implementation.
  - **Version-controlled repository**  
    - Public GitHub repo with a long commit history (~4,000+ commits), allowing users to browse changes and contributions over time.

  ## Licensing

  - The project is open source and licensed (license details are available in
  the repository’s **License** section on GitHub).


  ## Pricing

  - Access and use of the repository are **free** under its open-source license
  (no paid plans mentioned).
