# The Cancer Genome Atlas via GDC Portal

**URL:** https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/  
**Category:** Themed Directories  
**Tags:** genomics, health, datasets

## Overview
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is available through the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal, which serves as a repository and computational platform for cancer researchers. The portal provides harmonized clinical and genomic cancer data from foundational cancer genomic studies, including TCGA, enabling cross-study comparison, cohort building, and in silico analysis of cancer progression and treatment response.

## Key Data & Scale
- Data release example: Data Release 45.0 (December 04, 2025)
- 91 projects
- 69 primary cancer sites
- 50,270 cases
- 1,271,450 files
- 22,638 genes
- 3,324,495 mutations

*(Counts above are portal-wide and include but are not limited to TCGA.)*

## Included Studies (Examples)
- The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
- Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI)
- Foundation Medicine Inc. (FMI)
- Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)

## Features

### Data Access & Repository
- Centralized repository for clinical and genomic cancer datasets.
- Access to foundational cancer genomics studies including TCGA.
- Downloadable data files across many projects and primary sites.
- Repository / Downloads app for searching and retrieving data.

### Harmonized Clinical and Genomic Data
- Harmonized (standardized) clinical and genomic datasets for cross-study comparison.
- Clinical data standardized across hundreds of properties (e.g., demographics, diagnosis, treatment information).
- Genomic data processed via state-of-the-art bioinformatics workflows.
- Alignment of sequencing reads from multiple assay types, including:
  - Whole genome sequencing
  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (and other NGS modalities referenced by “ranging from whole genome to single-cell RNA”).
- Generation of high-level derived data products from raw sequence data.
- Documentation of the harmonization and processing pipelines via the GDC data processing resources.

### Analysis & Visualization Tools
- **Analysis Center** app for working with datasets and performing analyses within the portal ecosystem.
- **Projects** app to browse and explore available projects and associated datasets.
- **Cohort Builder** for in silico studies:
  - Build custom cohorts of cancer patients.
  - Apply a variety of clinical filters (e.g., demographics, diagnosis, treatment) and biospecimen filters.
  - Refine and compare cohorts based on genomic and clinical characteristics.
- Visual exploration of genomic alterations and related clinical features.

### Data Management Utilities
- **Cart** functionality for staging and managing selected files prior to download.
- **Manage Sets** for organizing user-defined groups (e.g., cohorts, file sets).
- **Browse Annotations** to view additional annotation information associated with cases/files.

### Documentation & Learning Resources
- Video tutorial guides for using the GDC Data Portal and its apps.
- Release notes for each data release, documenting newly added projects, datasets, and changes.

## Access & Usage
- Web-based access via the GDC Data Portal.
- User login for full functionality (e.g., managing sets, carts, and certain controlled-access datasets when applicable).

## Pricing
- No pricing information is provided in the available content. The portal is presented as a research data resource; any access controls or usage conditions are not detailed in the provided text.
