  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Data Visualization is a curated meta-collection that aggregates
  and indexes multiple “awesome” lists focused on data visualization. It serves
  as a hub to discover libraries, tools, frameworks, and resources for charts,
  dashboards, visual analytics, and related visualization techniques.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-collection of resources**
    - Aggregates many different “awesome” lists specifically about data visualization.
    - Provides a single entry point to explore visualization-related resources across GitHub.

  - **Data visualization focus**
    - Covers charts, dashboards, and visual analytics.
    - Includes tools and libraries for building visualizations.
    - Encompasses resources on visualization techniques and best practices.

  - **Index of awesome lists**
    - Points to specialized awesome lists maintained by various authors.
    - Helps users navigate to subdomains of visualization (e.g., web charts, scientific visualization, BI dashboards) via those lists.

  - **Tooling and libraries**
    - Collects links to visualization libraries and frameworks from different ecosystems (as exposed via the referenced awesome lists).
    - Includes utilities and tools that support the visualization workflow (e.g., dashboards, visual analytics platforms), as indexed by the source lists.

  - **Learning and reference resources**
    - Surfaces educational material and references found in underlying awesome lists, such as tutorials, guides, or conceptual overviews of visualization techniques.

  - **Open GitHub-based directory**
    - Hosted as a Markdown document in a public GitHub repository.
    - Can be browsed, forked, or extended by contributors through standard GitHub workflows.

  ## Target Use Cases

  - Discovering new data visualization libraries and tools via curated lists.

  - Exploring multiple awesome lists from a single meta-index instead of
  searching individually.

  - Using the directory as a starting point for research into charts,
  dashboards, and visual analytics.

  - Building internal or personal visualization stacks by comparing options
  referenced across lists.


  ## Pricing

  - Not a commercial product or service.

  - Publicly available GitHub directory with free access to the list content
  (subject to GitHub’s general usage terms).
