### Overview
Awesome Data – Social Sciences is a curated subset of the broader Awesome Data project, focused specifically on open datasets for the social sciences. It aggregates high-quality, research-grade data sources related to politics, law, society, religion, conflict, and violence, serving as a meta-directory for researchers, analysts, and practitioners.

### Features
- **Curated subset of Awesome Data:** Part of the larger Awesome Data ecosystem, but scoped to social sciences topics.
- **Focus on social science domains:**
  - Political conflict and international relations
  - Legal and judicial information
  - Public opinion and survey research
  - Religion and belief data
  - Violence, conflict, and security datasets
- **Collection of major social science datasets:** Includes references to widely used resources such as (examples mentioned):
  - ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data)
  - Correlates of War
  - GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone)
  - General Social Survey (GSS)
- **Meta-directory structure:** Functions as an "awesome-style" list, linking out to primary dataset providers rather than hosting data itself.
- **Open data orientation:** Emphasis on openly accessible, high-quality datasets suitable for academic and applied research.
- **For researchers and practitioners:** Organized to support use in empirical research, policy analysis, and data-driven social science projects.
