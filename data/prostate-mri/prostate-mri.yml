  # Prostate-MRI

  Collection](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Prostate-MRI)


  ## Description

  Prostate-MRI is a public medical imaging dataset of prostate Magnetic
  Resonance Images collected at 3T using an endorectal and phased array surface
  coil (Philips Achieva). All patients had biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer and
  underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Custom molds were generated
  from each MRI so that prostatectomy specimens could be sliced in the same
  plane as the MRI, enabling detailed radiology–pathology correlation. Data was
  generated at the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Maryland, USA) between
  2008–2010.


  The collection is part of The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and is suitable
  for research in prostate cancer imaging, computational modeling, and algorithm
  evaluation.


  ## Features


  ### Imaging and Clinical Characteristics

  - Prostate MRIs acquired at 3T (Philips Achieva).

  - Use of both endorectal coil and phased array surface coil for imaging.

  - All cases have:
    - Biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer.
    - Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy performed.
  - A patient-specific mold is generated from each MRI.

  - Prostatectomy specimens are placed in the mold and cut in the same plane as
  the MRI for precise alignment of histopathology with imaging.

  - Data timeframe: collected between 2008–2010.
