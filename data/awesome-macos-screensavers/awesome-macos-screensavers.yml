  ## Overview

  Awesome macOS Screensavers is a curated, open-source directory of screensavers
  available for macOS. Hosted on GitHub, it organizes links, screenshots, and
  brief descriptions of many different screensavers, making it easier to
  discover and explore visual and functional screensaver options for Mac.


  ## Features

  - **Curated directory format**
    - Manually maintained list focused specifically on macOS screensavers.
    - Inspired by the broader "awesome" lists ecosystem on GitHub.

  - **Categorized content**
    - Screensavers are organized into thematic sections (e.g., *Clocks*), helping you quickly find styles or functions you’re interested in.

  - **Individual entry descriptions**
    - Each screensaver entry includes:
      - Name
      - Short plain-language description of what it does or how it looks
      - Link to the project’s home page or repository
      - Screenshot image to preview appearance

  - **Example: Clock-based screensavers**
    - **fliqlo** – Flip clock–style screensaver.
    - **Today** – Displays time or date in a style reminiscent of On Kawara’s "Today Series" paintings.
    - **Word Clock (layout switching)** – Word-based clock that alternates between circular and paragraph layouts.
    - **Fractal Clock** – Clock that generates a moving fractal tree pattern around the clock face.
    - **Epoch Flip Clock** – Flip clock showing Unix time (epoch).
    - **Grid Clock** – Displays twelve-hour time written out in words.
    - **Word Clock (typing style)** – Minimal word clock that looks like the computer is typing out the current time.

  - **Visual previews**
    - Screenshot assets stored in a `/screenshots` folder and embedded into the list so you can visually compare options.

  - **Contribution guidelines**
    - `contributing.md` file provides instructions and conventions for adding new screensavers or improving the list.

  - **Open-source repository structure**
    - Hosted on GitHub with transparent commit history and file structure (`readme.md`, `screenshots/`, `contributing.md`).
    - Enables forking, starring, and issue-based collaboration.

  ## Pricing

  - The directory itself is free to access as an open-source GitHub repository.

  - Individual listed screensavers may have their own licensing or pricing,
  which is determined by their respective creators (not specified centrally in
  this list).
