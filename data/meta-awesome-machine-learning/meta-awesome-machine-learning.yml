  ## Description

  Meta Awesome - Machine Learning is a curated meta-directory that aggregates
  and organizes multiple "awesome" lists related to machine learning. It focuses
  on libraries, frameworks, tools, and educational resources for practitioners
  and learners in machine learning and data science.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-directory of ML resources**
    - Aggregates various machine learning–focused awesome lists into a single reference point.
    - Helps discover ML libraries, frameworks, and tools across different domains and ecosystems.

  - **Coverage of AI code creation tools (via linked GitHub ecosystem)**
    - **GitHub Copilot** – AI-assisted code completion and generation for developers.
    - **GitHub Spark** – Tools to build and deploy intelligent applications.
    - **GitHub Models** – Manage and compare prompts and model configurations.
    - **MCP Registry** – Integrate external tools via the Model Context Protocol.

  - **Developer workflow integrations (relevant to ML projects)**
    - **GitHub Actions** – Automate CI/CD pipelines and ML workflows.
    - **GitHub Codespaces** – Cloud-based development environments for ML experimentation.
    - **GitHub Issues** – Plan and track ML experiments, bugs, and tasks.
    - **Code Review** – Manage and review code changes to ML models and pipelines.

  - **Application security options for ML codebases**
    - **GitHub Advanced Security** – Find and fix security vulnerabilities in ML and data-processing code.
    - **Code Security** – Enforce secure coding practices during ML model and pipeline development.
    - **Secret Protection** – Prevent leakage of API keys, credentials, and other secrets used in ML workflows.

  - **Contextual exploration and learning**
    - Access to GitHub documentation, blog, and changelog for staying updated on tools used in ML projects.
    - Marketplace integrations for extending ML workflows with third-party tools.

  ## Use Cases

  - Discovering new machine learning libraries and frameworks.

  - Building end-to-end ML projects using integrated GitHub tools (coding,
  CI/CD, security).

  - Organizing and tracking ML experiments and data-science workflows.

  - Learning about AI, software development, DevOps, and security topics
  relevant to ML.


  ## Pricing

  No specific pricing information is provided for Meta Awesome - Machine
  Learning itself. It is hosted as an open GitHub document. Pricing, if any,
  applies only to external tools/services like GitHub products linked from the
  directory and should be checked on their respective pages.
