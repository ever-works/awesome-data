  ## Overview

  Awesome Radio is an open-source, curated directory of radio-related resources,
  tools, and software. It focuses on various aspects of radio
  communication—especially CB and hobbyist radio—and aggregates learning
  materials, utilities, and community knowledge for hackers and radio
  enthusiasts.


  ## Features


  - **Curated resource list**  
    - Aggregates radio-related software, tools, and learning resources.  
    - Inspired by the broader "awesome-*" ecosystem of curated lists.

  - **Focus on radio communication**  
    - Emphasizes technologies and practices around radio communication, including areas that may be regulated (e.g., FCC-regulated bands in the U.S.).  
    - Oriented toward people interested in the technical and practical side of radio rather than commercial use.

  - **CB (Citizens Band) radio coverage**  
    - Explanations of what CB radio is and how it is used.  
    - Notes that CB is license-free for most uses in the U.S. and many other countries.  
    - Documents the CB frequency range: 40 channels between **26.965 MHz and 27.405 MHz**.  
    - Identifies special-purpose channels:
      - **Channel 9** – dedicated to emergencies only.  
      - **Channel 19** – widely used as an unofficial trucker channel for traffic and route updates.
    - Practical usage expectations:
      - Typical range of **2–5 miles (3.2–8 km)** with a properly tuned antenna.

  - **Practical operating guidance (CB-specific)**  
    - Notes on common operating culture (use of handles, informal language).  
    - Reminds users that CB communication is fully public and effectively broadcast to anyone listening.  
    - Highlights usefulness for long-distance travel and real-time traffic reporting, especially along trucking routes.

  - **Structured documentation**  
    - `README.md` as the primary catalog of resources and notes.  
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing how to propose additions or changes to the list.  
    - `LICENSE` file specifying open-source licensing for the list contents.

  ## Use Cases

  - Discovering software and tools for radio streaming, broadcasting, and
  communication.  

  - Learning fundamentals and practical tips for CB and other radio systems.  

  - Exploring hobbyist and hacker-oriented radio projects and references.  

  - Contributing additional radio resources to an open-source directory.
