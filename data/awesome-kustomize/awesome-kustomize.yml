  ## Overview


  Awesome Kustomize is a community-maintained list of:

  - Kustomize learning resources

  - Plugins and tools

  - Code snippets and examples

  - Related projects in the Kubernetes ecosystem


  It centers on [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io), a template-free way to
  customize Kubernetes manifests using a purely declarative approach. Kustomize
  is available both as a standalone binary and built into `kubectl` (since
  Kubernetes v1.14).


  The repository is open to contributions via pull requests or issues.
