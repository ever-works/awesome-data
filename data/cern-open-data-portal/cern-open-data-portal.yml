  ## Overview


  The CERN Open Data Portal provides open access to more than five petabytes of
  particle-physics data from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and
  related facilities. It hosts datasets, software, analysis environments, and
  documentation intended for research, education, and data science applications.

  ## Features


  ### Data and Content Types

  - **Datasets**: Searchable catalog of physics datasets, including collision
  data and derived data products.

  - **Software**: Access to software used for data processing, analysis, and
  simulation.

  - **Environments**: Computing and analysis environments for working with open
  data.

  - **Documentation**: Guides, tutorials, technical notes, and glossary for
  understanding and using the data.

  - **News items**: Regularly updated announcements about new data releases,
  features, and experiment contributions.


  ### Search and Discovery

  - **Search by type**:
    - Datasets (`/search?type=Dataset`)
    - Software (`/search?type=Software`)
    - Environments (`/search?type=Environment`)
    - Documentation (`/search?type=Documentation`)
  - **Search examples and filters**:
    - Collision datasets (e.g., `/search?subtype=Collision&type=Dataset`)
    - Keyword search (e.g., `keywords=education`, `keywords=datascience`)
    - Collision energy filters (e.g., `collision_energy=7TeV`).
  - **Experiment-based browsing**:
    - ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, DELPHI, LHCb, OPERA, PHENIX, TOTEM (each with dedicated search filters like `/search?experiment=ATLAS`).
