  ## Overview

  Awesome VBA is a curated GitHub directory of frameworks, libraries, tools, and
  learning resources for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and Visual Basic 6
  (VB6), with a focus on Office automation and scripting. It aggregates
  community-maintained resources into a single, organized list.


  ## Features

  - **Curated awesome list**
    - Focused on VBA and VB6 ecosystems.
    - Includes frameworks, libraries, software, and general resources.

  - **Coverage of VBA platform specifics**
    - Notes that many libraries differ in compatibility across:
      - Operating systems (e.g., Windows vs. macOS).
      - Office applications (Excel, Word, Access, etc.).
      - Architectures (x64 vs x86 / 32-bit vs 64-bit).

  - **Symbology / compatibility indicators**
    - Uses icons/symbols to indicate:
      - Supported operating systems (e.g., Windows logo, “Not macOS”).
      - Supported Office applications (e.g., “All applications”).
      - Architecture constraints (e.g., 32‑bit only).
    - Dedicated explanation section for this symbology.

  - **Frameworks section**
    - Lists VBA/VB6 frameworks with:
      - Platform icons (Windows, Office, architecture notes).
      - GitHub star badges for quick popularity reference.

  - **Repository structure & documentation**
    - `README.md` as the main curated list and documentation.
    - `Contributing.md` explaining how to contribute new entries or updates.
    - `resources/` directory containing visual assets (e.g., logos, symbols).
    - Standard open-source license file (`LICENSE`).

  - **Open-source & community-driven**
    - Hosted as a public GitHub repository (`sancarn/awesome-vba`).
    - Accepts community contributions via pull requests.
