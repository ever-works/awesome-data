  # Meta Awesome - Middlewares


  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome - Middlewares is a curated, meta-awesome document that organizes
  links to “awesome” lists and resources focused on middleware components and
  patterns. It serves as an index for developers and architects who need to
  explore middleware technologies, integration tooling, and related
  architectural patterns.


  - **Type:** Meta-directory / curated resource list

  - **Category:** Meta-directories

  - **Primary focus:** Middleware components, libraries, and architectural
  patterns

  - **URL:**
  https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/middlewares.md


  ## Features

  - **Curated middleware index**
    - Aggregates multiple “awesome” lists and external resources specifically related to middleware.
    - Focuses on backend and integration middleware ecosystems.

  - **Organization by topic**
    - Groups resources around middleware concepts and components (e.g., integration middleware, service middleware, patterns).
    - Helps users navigate to more specialized awesome lists and repositories rather than searching from scratch.

  - **Meta-directory structure**
    - Acts as a high-level directory that points to other curated lists, not a standalone middleware library.
    - Designed to be extended or updated as new middleware-related awesome lists appear.

  - **Open, GitHub-hosted document**
    - Available as a markdown file in a public GitHub repository.
    - Can be forked, cloned, or referenced in other documentation.

  - **Developer- and integration-focused**
    - Targets backend developers, integration engineers, and architects looking for middleware solutions and patterns.

  ## Use Cases

  - Discovering new middleware frameworks, libraries, and tools via curated
  lists.

  - Exploring patterns and best practices for middleware in backend and
  integration architectures.

  - Using it as a starting point for research or technology evaluation across
  multiple middleware ecosystems.


  ## Pricing

  - **Cost:** Free (public GitHub document; no pricing or paid plans indicated).
