  # Awesome Executable Packing


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** security, reverse-engineering, awesome-lists  

  **Source:** https://github.com/dhondta/awesome-executable-packing


  ## Overview

  Awesome Executable Packing is a curated directory of resources focused on
  executable packing and unpacking across multiple formats, including:

  - Portable Executable (PE)

  - Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)

  - Other executable formats


  It collects technical references and practical tools relevant to binary
  obfuscation, compression, and analysis.


  ## Features

  - **Curated resource list**
    - Books on executable packing, protection, and reverse engineering
    - Academic and industry research papers
    - Blog posts, articles, and technical write-ups
    - Other written resources related to binary packing and obfuscation

  - **Tooling coverage**
    - Packers for various executable formats
    - Tools for detecting packed executables
    - Tools and frameworks for unpacking executables
    - Utilities relevant to binary obfuscation and compression workflows

  - **Format-agnostic scope**
    - Focus on PE (Windows), ELF (Unix-like systems), and additional executable formats
    - Emphasis on both theoretical and practical aspects of packing across platforms

  - **Conceptual focus**
    - Centers on _packing_ as the modification of an executable without changing its intended behavior
    - Encompasses typical packing-related operations used in obfuscation and compression contexts

  ## Pricing

  This is an open, GitHub-hosted curated list; no pricing or paid plans are
  indicated.
