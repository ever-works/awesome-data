  ## Overview


  Awesome Executable Packing is a curated, open-source directory of resources
  about packing and unpacking executable formats. It focuses on formats such as
  Portable Executable (PE), Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), and others,
  and aggregates learning materials, research, and tools used in software
  protection, reverse engineering, and malware analysis.


  ## What Is Covered


  * Concepts and techniques of executable packing (modifying an executable
  without changing its intended behavior).

  * Packing across multiple executable formats (e.g., PE, ELF, and more).

  * Both theoretical and practical aspects of detecting and unpacking packed
  executables.


  ## Features


  - **Curated Resource List**
    - Centralized catalog of references related to executable packing.
    - Emphasis on quality, relevance, and organization typical of "awesome" lists.

  - **Multi-Format Focus**
    - Includes resources for multiple executable formats:
      - Portable Executable (PE)
      - Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
      - Other common executable types

  - **Learning & Reference Materials**
    - Links to books
    - Academic and industry papers
    - Blog posts and technical write-ups
    - Other written resources explaining:
      - Packing concepts
      - Practical packing/unpacking workflows
      - Detection and analysis of packed binaries

  - **Packers Catalog**
    - References to various executable packers used for:
      - Software protection/obfuscation
      - Compression
      - Malware packing and evasion

  - **Detection & Unpacking Tools**
    - Tools for identifying whether an executable is packed
    - Tools and frameworks for unpacking executables
    - Resources oriented toward reverse engineering and security analysis

  - **Literature Sections**
    - **Documentation** section for practical how-to and reference docs
    - **Scientific Research** section for formal studies and research papers

  - **Open Collaboration**
    - Public repository with standard open-source meta-files:
      - `README.md` describing the list
      - `LICENSE` defining usage rights
      - `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines
      - `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` describing expected community behavior

  ## Use Cases


  - Learning executable packing techniques and theory

  - Studying malware packing and evasion strategies

  - Finding tools to detect and unpack packed executables

  - Supporting reverse engineering and binary analysis workflows


  ## Pricing


  - Not a commercial product or service.

  - Open-source GitHub directory, free to access and use under its published
  license.
