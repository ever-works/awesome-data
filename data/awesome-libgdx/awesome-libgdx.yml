  ## Overview


  Awesome libGDX is a curated directory of tools, libraries, tutorials, assets,
  and community resources for the libGDX Java game development framework. It
  follows the Awesome Manifesto and focuses on helping developers extend libGDX
  and build 2D/3D games more efficiently.


  ## Features


  ### Scope & Structure

  - Curated list specifically focused on the libGDX game framework.

  - Organized into clear sections: Resources, Tutorials, Assets, Community, and
  Other Lists.

  - Emphasis on production-useful libraries, tools, and learning materials
  rather than general Java/game content.


  ### Resource Categories


  #### Algorithms and AI

  - **gdx-ai** – AI framework for libGDX featuring:
    - Steering behaviors
    - Formation motion
    - Pathfinding
    - Behavior trees
    - Finite state machines (FSMs)
  - **Simple Graphs** – Java library for graph data structures and algorithms,
  including fast pathfinding, suitable for integration with libGDX games.


  #### Controllers

  - **gdx-controllers** – Adds support for gamepads and joysticks in libGDX
  projects.

  - **gdx-controllerutils** – Utility layer that provides:
    - Scene2D button input support
    - User-configurable button mappings
    - Hotplugging support for LWJGL2
  - **sdl2gdx** – SDL-based gamepad implementation with:
    - Unified mapping for hundreds of controllers
    - Rumble support
    - Hotplugging

  #### Editors

  - **HyperLap2D** – Visual editor for complex 2D worlds and scenes with a
  dedicated libGDX runtime.

  - **Mundus** – World/level editor for 3D worlds, including a runtime for
  libGDX integration.

  - **Spine** – 2D skeletal animation tool focused on game animation, commonly
  used with libGDX.


  #### Entity Component System (ECS)

  - **Artemis-odb** – High-performance, Java-based Entity–Component–System
  framework suitable for large or complex games.

  - **Ashley** – libGDX-related ECS framework, a Java entity system inspired by
  Ash and Artemis.


  #### Physics

  - **Box2D** – Widely-used 2D physics library, integrated as a libGDX
  extension.

  - **Bullet** – 3D collision detection and rigid body dynamics library with
  libGDX bindings.

  - **jbump** – AABB-based collision detection library aimed at simple 2D games
  like platformers.


  #### Services

  - **gdx-facebook** – Cross-platform access to the Facebook Graph API from
  libGDX games.

  - **gdx-fireapp** – Cross-platform API for integrating Firebase services.

  - **gdx-firebase** – Alternative cross-platform Firebase integration library
  for libGDX.


  #### Additional Sections (as defined in the list)

  - **Setup and Deployment** – Tools, scripts, and helpers for configuring,
  building, and deploying libGDX projects (desktop, mobile, web).

  - **User Interface** – UI libraries, widgets, and layout tools built on or for
  libGDX (e.g., Scene2D extensions and UI toolkits).

  - **Visual Effects** – Particle systems, shaders, post-processing, and visual
  enhancement tools.

  - **Audio** – Libraries and utilities for sound effects, music, and audio
  management.

  - **Others** – Miscellaneous utilities and helpers that don’t fit in the above
  categories but extend libGDX capabilities.


  ### Learning Resources

  - **Getting Started Tutorials** – Introductory guides for setting up libGDX
  and building first projects.

  - **Advanced Tutorials** – Deeper content on architecture, performance,
  rendering, AI, ECS, and platform-specific topics.


  ### Assets

  - Catalog of game-ready assets suitable for libGDX projects, such as sprites,
  tilesets, sound effects, music, and example projects.


  ### Community & Ecosystem

  - **Community** – Links to forums, chats, discussion groups, and other
  community hubs around libGDX.

  - **Other Lists** – Pointers to related “awesome” lists and broader game-dev
  resources.

  - Open to community contributions via standard pull-request workflow
  (contribution guidelines provided in the repository).


  ## Pricing


  - Awesome libGDX and all listed resources in the repository itself are free to
  access. (Individual third‑party tools or assets in the list may have their own
  licensing or pricing, which must be checked per item.)
