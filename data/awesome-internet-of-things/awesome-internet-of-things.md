### Description
Awesome Internet of Things (awesome-iot) is a curated GitHub list of Internet of Things projects and resources. It aggregates links to IoT-related hardware, software, protocols, platforms, and tools to help developers, researchers, and enthusiasts explore the IoT ecosystem.

### Features
- **Curated IoT Resource Directory**  
  - Collects “awesome” quality resources focused on the Internet of Things.  
  - Inspired by the broader awesome-lists ecosystem.

- **Hardware Section**  
  - Dedicated category for IoT hardware-oriented resources and projects (e.g., boards, sensors, and embedded devices).  
  - Intended to surface platforms and components commonly used in IoT development.

- **Software Section**  
  - **Operating Systems**: Links to operating systems tailored for embedded/IoT use cases.  
  - **Programming Languages**: Resources for languages and DSLs used in embedded and IoT development (compiled, interpreted, and domain-specific).  
  - **Frameworks**: IoT-related application and device frameworks to accelerate development.  
  - **Middlewares**: Middleware components for messaging, integration, and connectivity in IoT systems.  
  - **Libraries and Tools**: Utility libraries, SDKs, and toolchains useful for building and testing IoT solutions.  
  - **Miscellaneous**: Additional software or tooling that doesn’t fit neatly into the other software subsections.

- **Protocols and Networks Section**  
  - Organized overview of IoT communication standards and technologies.  
  - **Physical Layer**: Includes low-level communication standards such as:  
    - **IEEE 802.15.4** – Standard specifying physical layer and media access control for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs), often used as a basis for higher-level IoT protocols.

- **Open Source Repository Structure**  
  - Public GitHub repository (`HQarroum/awesome-iot`).  
  - `README.md` as the main index for the list.  
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing contribution guidelines.  
  - `LICENSE` defining usage and redistribution terms.  
  - Continuous integration configuration via `.travis.yml`.

- **Community & Quality Indicators**  
  - Part of the official "awesome" ecosystem (Awesome badge).  
  - Tested/validated with a CI build (Build Status badge).
