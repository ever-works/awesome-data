# Awesome Play1

A curated, community-maintained directory of libraries, modules, tools, and learning resources for the Play 1.x Framework.

## Overview

Awesome Play1 is an open-source, GitHub-hosted list that aggregates Play 1.x ecosystem components. It organizes third‑party modules, development tools, and documentation resources to help developers build and maintain Play 1.x applications more efficiently.

- **Type:** Open-source curated list / directory
- **Tech focus:** Play Framework 1.x
- **Format:** GitHub repository (Markdown list)
- **Ecosystem coverage:** Modules, tools, and general resources

## Features

### 1. Modules Directory

A categorized list of Play 1.x modules, each annotated with badges that describe its status and distribution.

**Module badge system:**
- **Registered on playframework.com/modules (registered):**  
  Indicates that a module is officially registered in the legacy Play module registry. The badge links to its page on `playframework.com/modules`.
- **Not registered on playframework.com/modules (external repo):**  
  Indicates that the module is not in the legacy registry and must be added via an external repository in `dependencies.yml`. The badge links to the official module page (typically a GitHub repo).
- **Mavenized:**  
  Shows that the module is available on Maven Central, typically via the `maven-play-plugin`. The badge links directly to the Maven repository artifact page.
- **Updated since registry freeze:**  
  Marks modules that have been updated after the official Play 1.x module registry was frozen, with the badge linking to the current official module page.

These badges help developers quickly understand:
- Where to fetch the module from
- How it is distributed (legacy registry vs external vs Maven Central)
- Whether it is actively maintained beyond the frozen registry

### 2. Tools

A section dedicated to tools that support Play 1.x development, such as:
- Build and integration tooling (e.g., Maven/`maven-play-plugin` integration)
- Development, profiling, or debugging aids (e.g., profiler-related tools referenced by badges)

*(The exact tool list is maintained in the repository README and can evolve through contributions.)*

### 3. Resources

A collection of links and materials for working with Play 1.x, for example:
- Documentation and guides
- Blog posts, tutorials, or reference material
- Other language- or ecosystem-specific awesome lists that complement Play 1.x development

### 4. Open Contribution Model

- Publicly maintained via GitHub pull requests
- Contribution guidelines available in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Encourages the community to add new modules, tools, and resources or update existing entries

### 5. GitHub-based Organization

- All entries are in a single `README.md` for easy browsing
- Uses badges and sections for quick visual scanning
- Version history and changes visible through standard GitHub commit history
