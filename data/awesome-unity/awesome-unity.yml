  ## Features


  - **Curated “awesome list” format**  
    A single, organized README that aggregates notable Unity-related tools, assets, and references from across the ecosystem.

  - **Categorized resources**  
    Entries are grouped into clear sections so developers can quickly find what they need:
    - **2D** – Assets, tools, and libraries tailored for 2D game development in Unity.
    - **AI** – Pathfinding, behavior trees, decision-making frameworks, and other AI-related tools.
    - **Augmented & Virtual Reality** – AR/VR tools, SDKs, and frameworks for building immersive experiences.
    - **Camera** – Camera controllers, systems, and utilities (e.g., advanced camera rigs, orbit/zoom systems).
    - **Character Controllers** – First-person, third-person, and other controller systems for characters and movement.
    - **Frameworks** – Architectural and utility frameworks that structure or extend Unity projects.
    - **Input** – Input handling systems and helpers beyond Unity’s built-in input.
    - **Modeling** – Tools and resources related to 3D modeling workflows used with Unity.
    - **Monetization** – Libraries and services for ads, in-app purchases, and revenue integration.
    - **Networking** – Multiplayer/network libraries, frameworks, and services for online features.
    - **Scripting** – Scripting helpers, libraries, and language/tooling integrations for coding in Unity.
    - **Services** – Online backends, analytics, live-ops, and other service integrations for Unity games.
    - **Tweening** – Tweening/animation libraries for smooth transitions and motion.
    - **UI** – User interface frameworks, widgets, UI layout helpers, and visual components.
    - **Utilities** – General-purpose helper tools, editor extensions, and productivity utilities.
    - **Video** – Video playback, rendering, and related tools within Unity.
    - **Visual Scripting** – Node-based or visual scripting systems for building logic without (or alongside) code.

  - **Project examples section**  
    - **Projects → Games** – Example Unity games that can serve as reference implementations or learning material.

  - **Emphasis on free resources**  
    Wherever possible, free assets and tools are preferred, making the list especially useful for students, hobbyists, and teams with limited budgets.

  - **Community-driven contributions**  
    - Open contribution model via pull requests (guided by documented contribution guidelines).
    - Acknowledgement of multiple contributors who have helped expand and maintain the list.

  - **License clarity**  
    - Distributed under the **CC0-1.0** license, placing the list itself in the public domain and allowing broad reuse of the curation.

  - **Historical stability**  
    - Repository is archived in its final state, providing a stable snapshot of a mature Unity resource ecosystem at the time of archiving.

  ## Pricing


  - **Cost:** Free  
    - The list itself is free to access and reuse (CC0-1.0).  
    - Individual items listed may be free or paid; the list prioritizes free entries, but pricing of external resources is determined by their respective owners.

  ## Notes


  - Repository is read-only as of Jan 22, 2025 (no new updates or pull requests
  accepted).  

  - Still useful as a reference starting point when exploring Unity tools,
  plugins, and learning materials across many categories.
