  A curated "awesome" list of experimental or seemingly impossible npm packages
  that actually exist.

  ## Overview


  Awesome Mad Science is a community-maintained collection of unusual,
  surprising, or highly experimental npm packages. The list highlights projects
  that push the boundaries of what’s typically done with JavaScript and npm.

  ## Features


  - **Curated Awesome List**
    - Organized as part of the broader "Awesome" ecosystem of curated lists.
    - Focuses specifically on "mad science"-style npm packages.

  - **Emphasis on Experimental / Unusual Packages**
    - Showcases npm modules that make you think "didn’t know that was possible with JavaScript/npm".
    - Includes packages that are novel, creative, or technically surprising.

  - **Topical Organization**
    - Packages are grouped into themed sections (as headings in the README):
      - **peer-to-peer** – npm packages related to P2P networking and distributed systems.
      - **browserify** – packages related to Browserify and bundling `require()` and `fs.readFileSync()` for the browser.
      - **files** – modules dealing with file handling and file system tricks.
      - **geometry** – geometry-related or math/graphics-oriented modules.
      - **hardware** – packages that interact with or control physical hardware.
      - **images** – image processing, generation, or manipulation tools.
      - **sound** – audio processing, synthesis, or sound-related packages.
      - **streams** – advanced or unusual use of Node.js streams.
      - **text** – text processing, transformations, or unusual text-related behavior.
      - **terminal** – terminal/CLI visualizations, interfaces, or effects.
      - **virtual machines** – JS-based VMs, emulators, or sandboxed runtimes.
      - **misc** – miscellaneous mad-science modules that don’t fit other categories.
      - **meta-programming** – code that writes or manipulates other code, or advanced language features.

  - **Community Contributions**
    - Pull requests are explicitly welcomed, encouraging community-curated additions and improvements.
    - Maintained on GitHub, with visible commit history and contributor list.
