**Category:** Themed Directories  
**Tags:** awesome-lists, cryptography, security

### Overview
A curated, community-maintained “awesome-style” directory of cryptography resources. It aggregates learning materials, libraries, and tools related to cryptography and security, organized in a single GitHub repository.

### Features
- **Curated resource list**
  - Focused specifically on cryptography and security topics.
  - Follows the common "awesome list" format and standards.

- **Broad resource coverage** (as indicated by description)
  - Learning materials (e.g., tutorials, articles, books, courses) related to cryptography.
  - Libraries implementing cryptographic primitives and protocols.
  - Tools used for cryptographic analysis, implementation, and experimentation.

- **GitHub-based directory**
  - Implemented as a public GitHub repository for easy browsing and cloning.
  - Repository includes standard project files such as:
    - `README.md` for the main list and documentation.
    - `LICENSE.md` for licensing information.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines.
    - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community behavior standards.
    - Configuration and meta files (`.github`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `yarn.lock`).

- **Community contributions**
  - Open to pull requests and issues for updating and expanding the list.
  - Multiple commits and history visible via GitHub, indicating ongoing maintenance.

- **Visual assets**
  - Includes an `awesome-crypto.png` graphic for branding or embedding.

### Target Audience
- Developers and engineers working with cryptography or secure systems.
- Students and learners seeking structured cryptography learning materials.
- Security researchers looking for libraries and tools.
- Anyone needing a centralized directory of cryptography-related links.

### Licensing
- The repository contains a `LICENSE.md` file; specific license terms are defined there (viewable in the GitHub repo).

### Pricing
- Not applicable — this is a free, open GitHub directory/list of resources.
