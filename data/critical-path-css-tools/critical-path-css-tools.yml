  # Critical-Path CSS Tools


  A curated directory of tools and resources for generating and managing
  critical-path (above-the-fold) CSS to improve page rendering performance.

  ## Overview


  Critical-Path CSS Tools is a curated list of open-source tools that help you:

  - Generate above-the-fold (critical-path) CSS

  - Inline critical CSS into HTML

  - Load remaining styles asynchronously

  - Integrate critical CSS workflows into build tools and servers


  The goal is to prioritize above-the-fold content so browsers can render the
  initial view as quickly as possible.

  ## Features


  ### Concept & Best Practices

  - Encourages inlining critical (above-the-fold) CSS directly into the HTML
  `<head>` to avoid extra round trips.

  - Recommends loading non-critical stylesheets later (e.g., in the footer),
  ideally asynchronously.

  - Focuses on improving perceived performance and faster first paint.


  ### Node Modules

  - **Penthouse**
    - Generates critical-path CSS for a page.
  - **Critical**
    - Generates and inlines critical-path CSS.
    - Built on top of Penthouse, Oust, and inline-styles.
  - **CriticalCSS** (Filament Group)
    - Finds and outputs critical CSS for a page.

  ### Server-Side Modules

  - **mod_pagespeed** (Apache)
    - Apache module for automatic PageSpeed optimization, including critical-path CSS related improvements.
  - **ngx_pagespeed** (Nginx)
    - Nginx module for automatic PageSpeed optimization with similar capabilities.

  ### Grunt Tasks (Build Tool Integration)

  - **grunt-penthouse**
    - Grunt task wrapper for Penthouse to generate critical CSS in Grunt workflows.
  - **grunt-critical-css**
    - Grunt task for generating critical CSS using Filament Group’s CriticalCSS.
  - **grunt-critical**
    - Grunt task for the Critical module to generate and inline critical-path CSS.

  ### CasperJS

  - **critical-css-casperjs**
    - CasperJS script to extract critical CSS information from web pages.

  ### PhantomJS

  - **dr-css-inliner**
    - PhantomJS script that inlines above-the-fold CSS directly into a page.

  ### Inline Sources (Styles & Scripts)

  - **inline-styles**
    - Replaces `<link>` tags with inline `<style>` tags.
    - Inlines CSS `url()` assets as data URIs.
  - **gulp-inline-source**
    - Gulp plugin that:
      - Replaces `<link>` tags with inline `<style>` tags.
      - Replaces `<script src="">` tags with inline script content.
  - **inline-critical**
    - Inlines critical-path CSS into HTML.
    - Loads existing external stylesheets using `loadCSS` for non-blocking behavior.
  - **isomorphic-style-loader** (for Webpack / React)
    - Allows extraction of critical CSS for specific pages/screens in React apps.
    - Supports inlining critical CSS into HTML during server-side rendering (SSR).
    - Used in projects like React Starter Kit.

  ### Async CSS Loading (Concept)

  - Promotes asynchronously loading the rest of the site-wide CSS after critical
  CSS is inlined, to avoid render-blocking.
