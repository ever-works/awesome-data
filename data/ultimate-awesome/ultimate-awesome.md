## Overview
`ultimate-awesome` is an automatically generated meta–awesome list that indexes and tracks (almost) every curated "awesome" list on GitHub. It focuses on awesome lists of open source software across all topics, including higher‑level lists that aggregate other awesome lists.

The list is built from the open API at `awesome.ecosyste.ms` and is regenerated daily.

## Features
- **Comprehensive index of awesome lists**  
  - Aggregates every awesome list tracked by awesome.ecosyste.ms that meets basic quality criteria.
  - Includes both topic‑specific lists and meta "lists of lists".

- **Automatic generation**  
  - The master list is generated automatically from the awesome.ecosyste.ms API.  
  - Reduces manual maintenance and keeps the directory in sync with the underlying ecosystem.

- **Quality thresholds**  
  - Only includes awesome lists that have:  
    - At least **30 items**, and  
    - A **description**.  
  - Helps filter out very small or incomplete lists.

- **Ranking by popularity**  
  - Lists are **sorted by GitHub stars (most stars first)**, surfacing the most widely adopted or recognized lists.

  - Regenerated **every day**.  
  - The README records the **“Last generated” date** and the **current count of lists** (e.g., *8959 lists* as of 2025‑12‑17).
