## Overview
Awesome Fuzzing is a curated, open-source directory of resources related to fuzz testing (fuzzing) for software security. It aggregates tools, frameworks, and academic literature focused on automated software testing using invalid, unexpected, or pseudo-random inputs to uncover crashes, assertion failures, and memory issues.

## Features

### Fuzzing Focus
- Dedicated to fuzz testing (fuzzing) and fuzz-based security testing.  
- Emphasizes automated testing with invalid, unexpected, and random inputs.  
- Targets programs that consume structured inputs (files, protocols, APIs, etc.).

### Structured Resource Directory
- **Books**: Curated list of books on fuzzing and related security testing topics.  
- **Talks**: Collection of presentations, conference talks, and lectures on fuzzing.  
- **Papers**: Academic and research papers focused on fuzzing techniques, theory, and practice.

### Research Coverage
- Focused on publications from major security venues between Jan 2008 and Jul 2019.  
- Includes papers from:
  - Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS)  
  - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (IEEE S&P)  
  - USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security)  
  - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS)  
- Additional papers from:
  - ArXiv (with emphasis on AI/ML-assisted fuzzing)  
  - Other relevant conferences and venues.

### Tools Directory
Directory of currently usable, primarily open-source fuzzing tools, organized and classified using the scheme from fuzzing-survey.org (over 35 possible categories, subset selected as most relevant). Outdated and deprecated tools are excluded. Main categories include:

- **File fuzzers** – For applications that process files and document formats.
- **Kernel fuzzers** – For operating system kernels and low-level components.
- **Network fuzzers** – For network protocols and services.
- **API fuzzers** – For web APIs and other programmatic interfaces.
- **JavaScript fuzzers** – For JS engines and JS-heavy applications.
- **Firmware fuzzers** – For firmware images and embedded systems.
- **Hypervisor fuzzers** – For virtualization and hypervisor layers.
- **CPU fuzzers** – For CPU emulators, instruction sets, and low-level execution.
- **Library (Lib) fuzzers** – For shared libraries and reusable components.
- **Web fuzzers** – For web applications and HTTP-based targets.
- **DOM fuzzers** – For browser DOM implementations and related components.
- **Argument fuzzers** – For command-line arguments and process invocation interfaces.
- **Blockchain fuzzers** – For blockchain clients and smart contracts.
- **DBMS fuzzers** – For database management systems and query interfaces.

### Curation & Quality
- Items are curated to be relevant to security and fuzz testing.  
- Only currently usable tools are listed; outdated/deprecated entries are filtered out.  
- Classification aligned with established fuzzing survey standards.

### Community & Contributions
- Open to community contributions via GitHub pull requests.  
- Contribution process documented in `contributing.md`.  
- Includes a `code-of-conduct.md` file defining expected behavior for contributors.

### Licensing
- Licensed under **CC0** (public domain dedication), allowing broad reuse of the list contents.

## Pricing
- Not a commercial product or service.  
- **Free** to access and use under the CC0 license.
