  **Tags:** meta-directory, developer-tools, IDE

  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – IDEs is a curated, Awesome-style directory within the broader
  Meta Awesome project that aggregates multiple integrated development
  environments (IDEs) and related developer tooling. It serves as a meta-list,
  pointing developers to various IDE-focused Awesome lists and resources in one
  place.


  ## Features

  - **Awesome-format catalog**
    - Uses the standardized “Awesome list” structure (sectioned lists, concise entries, external links).
    - Designed for easy browsing and contribution via Markdown on GitHub.

  - **Focus on IDEs and tooling**
    - Aggregates IDEs across different languages and platforms.
    - Includes related tooling (plugins, extensions, dev environments, etc.).

  - **Meta-directory structure**
    - Acts as a higher-level index that points to multiple IDE-related lists and resources rather than being a single standalone list.
    - Integrates into the larger Meta Awesome repository, which collects many topic-specific Awesome lists.

  - **GitHub-native format**
    - Hosted as a Markdown document within a GitHub repository.
    - Benefits from Git-based version control, pull requests, and issues for community-driven updates.

  - **Developer-centric organization**
    - Oriented toward developers looking to explore or compare IDEs.
    - Can be combined with other Meta Awesome documents for broader tooling discovery (e.g., CI/CD, security, dev workflows) via GitHub’s navigation and search.

  ## Use Cases

  - Discovering a range of IDEs and associated development tools.

  - Exploring IDE options for different programming languages or workflows.

  - Using as a starting point for deeper Awesome lists related to development
  environments.


  ## Pricing

  This is an open GitHub-hosted directory document, not a commercial product or
  service.  

  **Cost:** Free to access and use.
