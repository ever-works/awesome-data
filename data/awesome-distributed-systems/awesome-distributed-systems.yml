  # awesome-distributed-systems


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Platform:** GitHub  

  **Source:** https://github.com/theanalyst/awesome-distributed-systems


  ## Overview


  `awesome-distributed-systems` is a curated "awesome list" that aggregates
  high-quality educational resources on distributed systems. It focuses on
  theory, architecture, and foundational concepts rather than
  implementation-specific code, acting as a specialized directory within the
  broader Awesome collection.


  ## Features


  - **Curated bootcamp section** for newcomers to distributed systems, pointing
  to essential primers and conceptual overviews.

  - **Theory-focused resources** emphasizing architecture, correctness, and
  foundational results over language- or framework-specific code.

  - **Collection of seminal concepts and papers**, including:
    - CAP Theorem resources (original definition and plain-English explanation).
    - Fallacies of Distributed Computing, highlighting common incorrect assumptions.
    - FLP Impossibility Result (original paper and an accessible explanatory blog post).
  - **Guided learning path** via “Distributed systems theory for the distributed
  engineer,” which provides a breadth-first survey of core literature.

  - **Introductory course material** such as “An Introduction to Distributed
  Systems” by @aphyr.

  - **Books and long-form resources**, including:
    - *Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit* (free online book).
    - *Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms* by Andrew Tanenbaum (free with registration).
    - *Scalable Web Architecture and Distributed Systems* (free resource from AOSA).
    - *Principles of Distributed Systems* (ETH Zurich lecture material, free PDF).
    - *Making Reliable Distributed Systems in the Presence of Software Errors* (Joe Armstrong’s PhD thesis, free PDF).
  - **Free and open-access focus**: many listed items are explicitly free or
  freely accessible with simple registration.

  - **Community-aligned structure** modeled on other popular Awesome lists
  (e.g., awesome-python), making it familiar to GitHub users.


  ## Content Structure


  - **Bootcamp** – starting-point readings and conceptual primers.

  - **Books** – textbooks, lecture notes, and in-depth guides relevant to
  distributed systems.

  - Additional sections (not fully visible in the provided excerpt) are
  typically organized by topic, resource type, or technology, following the
  Awesome list style.


  ## Pricing


  - The repository itself is **free to access and use** on GitHub.

  - Many linked resources are **free** (some may require free registration, as
  noted).
