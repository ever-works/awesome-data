  ### Description

  Meta Awesome – Data Structures is a sublist within the broader Meta Awesome
  collection that focuses specifically on data structures. It serves as a
  curated directory of links to existing “awesome” lists and other high‑quality
  resources covering both fundamental and advanced data structures.


  ### Features

  - **Awesome-style sublist**: Follows the common “awesome list” convention
  (curated, link-based, community-friendly format).

  - **Focused on data structures**: Dedicated to resources that explain,
  implement, or deeply analyze data structures.

  - **Meta-directory of resources**: Aggregates other curated lists, guides, and
  repositories rather than duplicating their content.

  - **Covers multiple levels of difficulty**: Includes links for both
  foundational data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables)
  and more advanced or specialized structures.

  - **Organized link collection**: Structured to help users quickly discover
  relevant data-structure-related materials across the GitHub ecosystem and
  beyond.

  - **Part of Meta Awesome collection**: Integrated into a larger
  meta-collection that indexes many different awesome lists by topic.


  ### Pricing

  - Not applicable (GitHub-hosted, open directory of links).
