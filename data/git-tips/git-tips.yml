  ## Overview

  Git Tips is a repository of practical Git commands and patterns, organized as
  small, copyable snippets. It focuses on everyday workflows (branching, history
  inspection, reset/revert, cleanup, etc.) and serves as a quick reference for
  developers using Git from the command line.


  The collection is community-driven and available in multiple languages.

  - **Everyday workflows**
    - "Everyday Git in twenty commands or so" – a compact set of commands for routine daily Git usage.

  - **Authorship & metadata**
    - Reword the previous commit message.
    - Amend the author of a commit.
    - Reset author info after global config author has changed.

  - **Index and staging**
    - Stage parts of a changed file instead of the entire file (interactive staging).

  - **Shell integration & quality of life**
    - Enable Git bash completion.
    - Show what changed since a given time period (e.g., "since two weeks").
