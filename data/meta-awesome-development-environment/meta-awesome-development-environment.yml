  ## Meta Awesome – Development Environment

  **Website:** https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/development-environment.md  
  **Category:** Meta Directories  
  **Tags:** meta-directory, developer-tools, environment

  ### Overview
  Meta Awesome – Development Environment is a curated meta-index of “awesome” lists focused on development environments. It aggregates links to collections about editors, IDEs, terminals, shells, and related configuration and tooling resources, helping developers discover and compare environment setups from across the GitHub awesome ecosystem.

  ### Features
  - **Meta index of development-environment lists**  
    Aggregates multiple awesome lists that are specifically about development environments rather than general programming topics.

  - **Coverage of editors and IDEs**  
    Includes references to awesome lists for code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs), such as configuration, plugins, themes, and productivity enhancements.

  - **Terminal and shell tooling**  
    Points to lists focused on terminal emulators, shells (e.g., bash, zsh, fish), prompt customizations, and command-line productivity tools.

  - **Environment configuration resources**  
    Collects links to resources for dotfiles, configuration management, and environment setup scripts that help standardize or automate dev environment setup.

  - **Organization by topic**  
    Groups linked awesome lists by subtopic (e.g., editors, IDEs, terminals, configs) to make navigation easier.

  - **GitHub-based curation**  
    Built as a GitHub document, allowing the community to discover it, star it, and navigate directly to the underlying awesome lists.

  - **Ecosystem entry point**  
    Serves as a starting hub for exploring many independent development environment projects and collections, rather than maintaining its own tools.

  ### Pricing
  - Not applicable. This is a free, GitHub-hosted meta-directory of open lists and resources.
