    - **Miscellaneous** – items that don’t fit neatly into other categories.
    - **Multimedia** – workflows for audio, video, and media handling.
    - **Security** – workflows for security-related tasks (e.g., interacting with config files such as `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, `~/.ssh/config`, `/etc/hosts`).
    - **System** – workflows to control or query macOS system settings and information (e.g., network interfaces like `en0`).
    - **Web** – workflows interacting with web services or browsers.
    - **Helpers** – supporting or utility workflows that assist other workflows or general tasks.
