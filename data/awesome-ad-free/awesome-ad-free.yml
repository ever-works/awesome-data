  # Awesome Ad-Free


  A curated, community-maintained list of ad‑free alternatives to popular web
  services, software, and publications, with an emphasis on privacy and cleaner
  user experiences.

  ## Overview


  Awesome Ad-Free is an "awesome list"–style directory that catalogs services,
  apps, and content platforms that do **not** rely on advertising. It helps
  users discover options that reduce tracking and visual clutter while
  encouraging direct support models (e.g., subscriptions, donations, or other
  non‑ad funding).


  The project is open-source and released under the **CC0 1.0** license, making
  the list free to share, reuse, and adapt.
