  low-code / no-code environments (not necessarily MongoDB-specific but
  compatible).

  - **Shell**: Tools and enhancements related to the MongoDB shell experience.

  - **Web**: Web-based interfaces and dashboards for working with MongoDB.


  For several tool categories, the list also distinguishes **Services** (hosted
  or SaaS tools) from self-hosted or local tools.
