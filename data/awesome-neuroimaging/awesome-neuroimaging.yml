  ## Features


  ### Scope

  - Focus on neuroimaging of living subjects, especially MR-based data.

  - Includes tools for both brain images and electrophysiological recordings.

  - Emphasis on analysis workflows, data organization, and quality assurance.


  ### Viewers

  - **wb_view** – Tool for viewing neuroimaging data (part of the listed
  ecosystem of viewers).


  ### Acquisition

  - **MR**
    - **Organization** – Category for tools dealing with organizing MR acquisition data.
    - **Management** – Category for tools and scripts related to managing MR datasets and sessions.
    - **Motion**
      - `Dimon` – Tool focused on motion-related handling/processing in MR acquisitions.

  ### Quality Assurance and Checking

  - **QA and QC of scanner images** – Category for tools and workflows that
  check and monitor the quality of scanner output and acquired images.


  ### Pipelines

  - **Preprocessing workflows** – Collection of tools and scripts to perform
  common preprocessing steps.

  - **Suites** – Comprehensive software packages for multiple imaging
  modalities, often including graphical user interfaces.

  - **BOLD**
    - `afni_proc.py` – Pipeline tool for preprocessing BOLD fMRI data.
  - **DSI** – Category placeholder for diffusion spectrum imaging pipelines.

  - **Structural** – Category placeholder for structural MRI preprocessing
  pipelines.


  ### Raw Data

  - Tools for handling raw scanner output, including DICOM and k-space data:
    - `pydicom` – Python library for working with DICOM files.
    - `dicom_hinfo` – Utility for extracting header information from DICOM files.
    - `dicom_hdr` – Tool for inspecting DICOM headers.
    - `dcmdirtab` – Utility related to organizing or listing DICOM directories.
    - `dcmtab_bids` – Tool for mapping/organizing DICOM data into BIDS-like structures.

  ### Provenance and Automation

  - Tools and patterns for recording data lineage and automating workflows:
    - `Makefile` – Use of Makefiles for reproducible, scripted processing.
    - `datalad run --input=... --output=...` – Command pattern for reproducible, version-controlled execution with DataLad.
    - `3dNotes` – Tool for embedding or managing notes/metadata in imaging datasets.
    - `niinote` – Utility for attaching or handling notes and provenance in NIfTI or related files.

  ### Imaging Tools
