  # Meta Awesome - Frameworks


  **Description**


  Meta Awesome - Frameworks is a central meta-directory that indexes curated
  "awesome" lists focused on software frameworks. It aggregates lists for
  full‑stack and specialized frameworks across multiple ecosystems, making it
  easier to discover framework-specific awesome lists in one place.


  - **Website/Source**:
  https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/frameworks.md

  - **Category**: Meta-directories

  - **Tags**: `framework`, `directory-of-directories`, `awesome-lists`


  ## Features


  - **Meta-directory of framework lists**: Acts as an index of existing
  "awesome" lists rather than duplicating their content.

  - **Focus on frameworks**: Dedicated specifically to software frameworks
  (including full‑stack and specialized frameworks).

  - **Cross-ecosystem coverage**: Includes framework lists from different
  programming languages and technology ecosystems.

  - **Curated awesome lists**: Points to community-maintained awesome lists that
  follow the popular awesome-list convention.

  - **Centralized discovery**: Provides a single entry point to find
  framework-related awesome lists without searching each ecosystem individually.

  - **Organized documentation**: Lives in a documented index file
  (`frameworks.md`) within the `meta-awesome` repository.
