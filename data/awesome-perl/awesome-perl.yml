  ## Overview

  Awesome Perl is a curated, community-maintained list of notable Perl
  resources, including frameworks, libraries, tools, and software. It is part of
  the broader "awesome" list ecosystem and is inspired by the awesome-go
  project.


  ## Features

  - **Curated resource list**
    - Focuses on high-quality, notable Perl modules, tools, and related software.
    - Organized to help developers quickly discover libraries suited to common tasks.

  - **Category-based organization**
    - **Args** – Libraries for argument handling, manifestation, and validation.
    - **Audio / DSP** – Audio-related libraries, including digital signal processing.
    - **Benchmarks** – Libraries for benchmarking and performance measurement.
    - **Caches** – Libraries for interacting with cache software.
    - **Class Builder** – Libraries supporting class creation and metaprogramming (e.g., concise class syntax, attributes, and methods).
    - **CLI** – Libraries for building command-line applications.
    - **Cloud** – Modules for interacting with cloud services (category placeholder for cloud-related tools).
    - **Cryptography** – Cryptographic utilities and primitives.
    - **Commercial WebServices** – Clients and helpers for commercial web APIs.
    - **Container** – Libraries for implementing the Singleton pattern and similar container abstractions.
    - **Data Format** – Libraries for serializing, formatting, and parsing data.

    - **Database Drivers** – Drivers for specific database products, including:
      - Relational databases
      - NoSQL databases
    - **Date & Time** – Libraries for date/time representation, parsing, and manipulation.
    - **Devices** – Libraries for communicating with physical devices.
    - **DevOps Tools** – Tools and libraries for deployment and working across networks/hosts.
    - **Email** – Libraries for composing and sending email messages.
    - **Event Loops** – Event loop implementations and async programming utilities.
    - **Exception Handling** – Alternatives and helpers beyond basic `eval { die }` style error handling.
    - **DOM Manipulation** – Libraries for working with and manipulating DOM structures.
    - **File Manipulation** – Tools for interacting with and transforming files.
    - **Form Frameworks** – Frameworks to simplify creation and processing of (web/UI) forms.
    - **Images** – Libraries for image manipulation.
    - **List Manipulation** – Utilities for operating on lists/arrays.
    - **Logging** – Libraries for structured logging and log management (category present; list partially shown in content).

  - **Supplementary lists**
    - References to other recommended Perl module lists under “Another module list,” providing alternative or additional curated resources.

  - **Repository structure and tooling**
    - `README.md` – Main list of resources and category descriptions.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` – Contribution guidelines for adding or updating entries.
    - `LICENSE` – Specifies licensing for the curated list content.
    - `.travis.yml` – Continuous integration configuration for basic checks.
    - `cpanfile` – Declares Perl dependencies used for testing/validation of the list.
    - `t/` – Test files supporting automated validation of the list’s structure or metadata.

  - **Community-driven curation**
    - Open to pull requests for new entries and improvements.
    - Maintained as a GitHub repository, leveraging standard GitHub workflows.
