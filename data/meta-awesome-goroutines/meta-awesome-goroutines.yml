  ## Overview


  **Meta Awesome - Goroutines** is a focused sublist within the Meta Awesome
  collection that aggregates resources specifically about Go goroutines,
  concurrency patterns, and related tooling. It serves as a curated entry point
  for developers who want to explore learning materials, libraries, and tools
  around Go’s concurrency primitives.


  ## Features


  - **Focused Topic Scope**  
    - Dedicated to **Go goroutines** and concurrency.  
    - Narrow, topic-specific slice of the broader Meta Awesome list.

  - **Curated Resource Collection**  
    - Collects links and references about goroutines usage.  
    - Includes content on **concurrency patterns** in Go.  
    - Covers **tooling** that supports development, analysis, or debugging of goroutine-based code.

  - **Part of Meta Awesome Ecosystem**  
    - Integrated into the Meta Awesome repository as a sub-document (`doc/goroutines.md`).  
    - Benefits from Meta Awesome’s structure for organizing and maintaining multiple topic lists.

  - **Developer-Oriented Content**  
    - Targets Go developers and learners.  
    - Emphasis on technical learning resources rather than marketing or product promotion.
