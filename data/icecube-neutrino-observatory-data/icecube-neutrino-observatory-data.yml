  ## Overview

  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory Data collection provides publicly released datasets from AMANDA/IceCube researchers. These datasets support research on high‑energy cosmic neutrinos and related astrophysical phenomena, including notable sources such as the blazar TXS 0506+056.

  Data are released after IceCube’s main analyses are completed and results are published by the international collaboration, to ensure appropriate event reconstruction, background rejection, and treatment of systematic effects.

  ## Features

  - **Open scientific datasets**
    - Data products generated by the AMANDA/IceCube collaborations.
    - Intended for use by the wider scientific and research community.

  - **Featured high‑energy neutrino source datasets**
    - Datasets related to the first identified likely source of high‑energy neutrinos and cosmic rays (blazar TXS 0506+056).
    - Underpin analyses presented in two Science papers (2018) on:
      - The neutrino alert event IceCube‑170922A and coincident electromagnetic observations of TXS 0506+056.
      - Neutrino point‑source data in the direction of TXS 0506+056 prior to the alert.

  - **Specific downloadable datasets**
    - **IceCube 2008–2017 data for TXS 0506+056 analysis**  
      Direct download: https://icecube.wisc.edu/science/data/TXS0506_point_source
    - **IceCube catalog of alert events up through IceCube‑170922A**  
      Direct download: https://icecube.wisc.edu/science/data/TXS0506_alerts

  - **Documented data releases**
    - Each data‑release page includes a basic description of:
      - What data were collected.
      - How the data are organized.
      - Links to the relevant data files.

  - **Data‑release policy**
    - Commitment to releasing data after:
      - Completion of the primary collaboration analyses.
      - Publication of main results.
    - Designed to account for complex reconstruction, background rejection, and systematic uncertainties.
