  # GitHub Collaboration Archive (GH Archive)


  ## Overview

  GitHub Collaboration Archive (GH Archive) is a continuously updated archive of
  public GitHub events. It records and stores the public GitHub timeline and
  makes it accessible for large-scale analysis of developer activity,
  collaboration patterns, and repository events.


  - **Type:** Dataset / public event archive

  - **Category:** Datasets

  - **Source:** https://www.gharchive.org/

  - **Data domain:** Public GitHub events (commits, forks, issues, comments,
  membership changes, and more)


  ## Features


  ### Data Coverage & Content

  - Records public GitHub timeline events from GitHub’s event stream.

  - Supports 15+ official GitHub event types (e.g., pushes, forks, issue events,
  pull requests, comments, membership changes).

  - Each archive file contains JSON-encoded events as returned by the GitHub
  API.

  - Includes structured fields matching GitHub’s activity/event API response
  format.

  - Provides a `payload` field with JSON-encoded activity details.

  - Provides an `other` field containing remaining, less common fields.


  ### Data Access via HTTP Archives

  - Events are aggregated into **hourly archive files**.

  - Archives are available via simple HTTP endpoints (compatible with tools like
  `wget` or any HTTP client).

  - Example access patterns:
    - Activity for a specific hour: `https://data.gharchive.org/2015-01-01-15.json.gz`
    - Activity for a specific day (all hours): `https://data.gharchive.org/2015-01-01-{0..23}.json.gz`
    - Activity for a full month (all days, all hours): `https://data.gharchive.org/2015-01-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz`
  - Data is provided as compressed (`.json.gz`) JSON files for efficient
  download.

  - Suitable for offline processing: custom scripts, ingestion into databases,
  or data pipelines.


  ### BigQuery Public Dataset Integration

  - Entire archive is mirrored as a **public dataset on Google BigQuery**.

  - Dataset is **automatically updated hourly** to stay in sync with new GitHub
  events.

  - Enables **SQL-like querying** over the full event history.

  - Supports fast, large-scale analysis (seconds to query across large time
  ranges, subject to BigQuery performance and quotas).


  #### BigQuery Tables & Organization

  - Multiple tables organized by year and finer-grained partitions, for example:
    - `2011`, `2012`, `2013`, `2014`, `2015`
    - `201501` (month-level granularity)
    - `20150101` (day-level granularity)
  - Table wildcard functions can be used to query across multiple tables in one
  query (e.g., across multiple days or months).


  #### BigQuery Schema

  - Schema mirrors GitHub’s event API structure.

  - Common activity fields are exposed as separate columns.

  - `payload` column stores JSON-encoded activity details, which can be parsed
  using functions like `JSON_EXTRACT()`.

  - `other` column stores additional, less common fields as a JSON string.


  ### Example Usage & Workflow

  - Download raw hourly JSON archives for:
    - Custom aggregation scripts (e.g., in Ruby, Python, etc.).
    - Import into relational or NoSQL databases.
    - Feeding dashboards or analytics tools.
  - Run BigQuery queries for:
    - Analyzing project popularity and activity over time.
    - Studying collaboration networks and social coding patterns.
    - Generating reports or feeds of trending repositories.

  ### Related Outputs / Reports

  - Data powers external reporting products such as Changelog’s daily and weekly
  reports:
    - **Changelog Nightly**: daily email highlighting hot new GitHub repositories, built on GH Archive data.
    - **Changelog Weekly**: curated, less frequent digest leveraging the same underlying dataset.

  ### Openness & Community

  - Project source code is available on GitHub: `igrigorik/gharchive.org`.

  - Open to community contributions (e.g., adding research, visualizations, or
  projects built on GH Archive via pull requests).


  ## Pricing

  - Access to the raw GH Archive HTTP data is not described as paid; it is
  presented as an open public archive.

  - When using the Google BigQuery public dataset:
    - BigQuery provides **1 TB of data processed per month free of charge** (subject to Google Cloud’s own pricing and quotas).
    - Additional BigQuery usage beyond the free tier is billed by Google according to their BigQuery pricing (not set by GH Archive).

  *(No distinct pricing plans or tiers specific to GH Archive itself are
  described in the provided content.)*
