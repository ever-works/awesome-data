  # Labeled Faces in the Wild


  ![Labeled Faces in the
  Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/images/lfw_funneled.jpg)


  ## Overview

  Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) is a widely used benchmark dataset for
  unconstrained face recognition research. It consists of thousands of labeled
  face images collected from the web and is considered a de facto standard test
  set for evaluating face verification and identification algorithms.


  - **Type:** Dataset

  - **Category:** Datasets

  - **Domain:** Computer Vision, Machine Learning

  - **Primary Task:** Face verification and face recognition in unconstrained
  settings

  - **Provider / Origin:** University of Massachusetts Amherst

  - **Official Site / Documentation:** http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/


  ## Features

  - **Dataset Scale**
    - Contains **more than 13,000 labeled facial images**.
    - Images correspond to **1,680 different people**.

  - **Data Source & Collection**
    - Faces are **collected from the web**, reflecting natural, real-world image conditions.
    - Images are “in the wild” (unconstrained), rather than studio or controlled settings.

  - **Task Orientation**
    - Designed primarily for **face verification** (deciding whether two images are of the same person).
    - Commonly used as a benchmark for **face identification** experiments as well.

  - **Benchmark Status**
    - Described as the **de facto academic test set** for face verification.
    - Frequently used to report and compare performance of deep learning models (e.g., FaceNet).
    - Well-established in research literature and “awesome machine learning dataset” collections.

  - **Typical Usage in Research**
    - Evaluation of **deep face embedding models** (e.g., FaceNet) via verification accuracy.
    - Threshold-based verification experiments where **Euclidean distance** between embeddings is used as a similarity measure.
    - Comparison and benchmarking of new face recognition systems and architectures.

  ## Example Benchmark Reference (from content)

  - FaceNet reported:
    - **98.87% ± 0.15** accuracy on LFW in one setting.
    - **99.63% ± 0.09** accuracy on LFW in another setting.
    - An example optimal verification threshold around **1.24** (on embedding distance), illustrating common LFW usage.
