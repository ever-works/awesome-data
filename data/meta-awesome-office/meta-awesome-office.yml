  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Office is a curated meta-list of “awesome” lists focused on
  office software, productivity suites, and document tooling. It serves as an
  index that points to many specialized collections across the
  office/productivity ecosystem.


  ## Features

  - **Curated meta-directory** of links to multiple “awesome” lists related to
  office and productivity tools.

  - **Focus on office software** such as word processors, spreadsheets,
  presentation tools, and related utilities (as implied by the document title
  `office.md`).

  - **Coverage of productivity suites** and ecosystems surrounding document
  creation, editing, and management.

  - **Document tooling emphasis**, including tools that help with formatting,
  conversion, collaboration, and automation of office documents (inferred from
  the description).

  - **GitHub-hosted list**, allowing community contributions via issues and pull
  requests.

  - **Part of a broader Meta Awesome project**, meaning it is one section within
  a larger collection of themed meta-lists.
