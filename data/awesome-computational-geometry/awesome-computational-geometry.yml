  > A curated directory of computational geometry visualizations, libraries, and
  learning resources.


  - **Website**: https://github.com/atkirtland/awesome-computational-geometry

  - **Category**: Themed directories

  - **Tags**: geometry, algorithms, math


  ## Overview

  Awesome Computational Geometry is an open, curated list of links related to
  computational geometry. It aggregates visualizations of algorithms, textbooks,
  notes, libraries, courses, and related academic venues.


  ## Features


  ### 1. Algorithm Visualizations

  Interactive and visual resources to understand key computational geometry
  structures and algorithms:


  - **Convex Hull** – Visualization of the convex hull as the smallest convex
  set containing a given point set.

  - **Convex Hull Algorithms** – Visual demos of multiple convex hull
  algorithms, including:
    - Gift wrapping
    - Graham’s scan
    - Quickhull
    - Divide and conquer
    - Monotone chain
    - Chan’s algorithm
  - **Chan’s Algorithm** – Step visualization of this optimal output-sensitive
  convex hull algorithm in 2D/3D.

  - **Kirkpatrick’s Point Location** – Visualization of a triangulation-based
  point-location data structure with:
    - O(n) space
    - O(log n) query time
  - **Voronoi Diagrams** – Visual representation of plane partitioning into
  regions closest to given points.

  - **Fortune’s Algorithm** – Sweep-line Voronoi diagram construction with:
    - O(n log n) time
    - O(n) space
  - **k-d Tree** – Visualization of k-dimensional space partitioning for
  nearest-neighbor and related searches.

  - **Configuration Space** – Visual explanation of configuration spaces for
  objects such as robots.

  - **CGViz: Computational Geometry Interactive Visualizations** – FOSS web app
  for step-by-step computational geometry algorithm visualizations, aimed at:
    - Exploration
    - Teaching
    - Creating exportable visuals

  in various languages.

  - **Conferences**
    - Strictly computational geometry conferences
    - Broader conferences that include computational geometry tracks
  - **Journals** – Academic journals publishing computational geometry research.

  - **Competitive Programming** – Problem sets and geometry-focused resources
  for contests.

  - **Courses**
    - Open online courses
