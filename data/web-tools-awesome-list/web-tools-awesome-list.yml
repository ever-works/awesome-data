  ## Overview


  Web Tools (Awesome List) is a curated directory of hosted web-based tools and
  utilities for web development. It organizes links to online services that help
  with common frontend and backend development tasks, presented in the
  well-known "awesome list" format.


  ## Features


  - **Curated awesome list format**
    - Follows the community-driven "awesome" list convention for organizing and presenting resources.
    - Focuses specifically on *hosted* (online) tools rather than libraries or local software.

  - **Category-based organization**
    - Tools are grouped into topical sections so developers can quickly find what they need:
      - **Response** – tools for inspecting, testing, or formatting HTTP responses.
      - **Placeholder** – services for generating placeholder images or content for design and prototyping.
      - **Favicon** – tools to create, generate, or manage favicons and app icons.
      - **CDN** – content delivery network–related utilities and hosted CDNs useful for web assets.
      - **CSS** – online CSS tools such as generators, formatters, and analyzers.
      - **Image compression** – web-based image optimization and compression tools.
      - **JavaScript** – hosted JavaScript utilities, formatters, bundlers, or analyzers.
      - **Pagespeed** – services to analyze and measure website performance and loading speed.
      - **Color** – color palette generators, pickers, and contrast/accessible color tools.
      - **Font** – tools for browsing, combining, and testing web fonts.
      - **Forms** – utilities related to building, handling, or testing web forms.
      - **API Debugging** – online tools for testing and debugging APIs.
      - **API Doc** – services for generating, hosting, or interacting with API documentation.
      - **Git Host** – platforms and tools around hosting and managing Git repositories.
      - **webpack** – online helpers and utilities focused on webpack configurations or builds.
      - **Code Playgrounds** – browser-based coding sandboxes for experimenting with code.
      - **CheatSheet** – reference-style tools and cheat sheets for various web technologies.
      - **UI Builders** – visual or component-based UI creation tools.
      - **Tools collection** – meta-collections that aggregate multiple development tools.

  - **Hosted tools focus**
    - Emphasis on tools that run in the browser, requiring no local installation.
    - Suitable for quick tasks, prototyping, and cross-platform workflows.

  - **Open repository**
    - Public GitHub repository where the list is maintained.
    - Community can review and contribute via standard GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests).

  ## Pricing


  - The list itself is **free to access** as a public GitHub repository.  

  - Individual tools listed may have their own pricing models, but those details
  are not defined within this repository content.
