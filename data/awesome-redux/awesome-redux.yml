  ## Overview


  Awesome Redux is a curated directory of Redux-related libraries, tools,
  boilerplates, and learning resources for managing application state in
  JavaScript apps. It organizes the Redux ecosystem into clear categories to
  help developers find suitable solutions for architecture, side effects,
  integrations, and education.


  ---


  ## Features


  ### 1. Code Architecture

  Resources focused on improving the structure and organization of Redux-based
  codebases, with the goal of making code easier to reason about and maintain.


  ### 2. Utilities

  General-purpose tools and helpers for Redux applications, including:

  - **Store Persistence** – Libraries and patterns to persist and rehydrate the
  Redux store across sessions.

  - **Side Effects / Asynchronous Actions** – Tools and middleware to manage
  side effects such as API calls, timers, and other async workflows.


  ### 3. Code Style

  Resources that help make Redux-related source code easier to read and write,
  including style helpers, conventions, or abstractions.


  ### 4. Dev Tools / Inspection Tools

  Developer tooling for:

  - Inspecting Redux state and actions

  - Debugging and time-travel

  - Monitoring and analyzing Redux behavior during development


  ### 5. React Integration

  Libraries and patterns for combining Redux with React, including:

  - **Routing** – Integration of routing solutions with Redux-managed state.

  - **Forms** – Form management solutions that use or connect to Redux.

  - **Component State** – Approaches to coordinating local component state with
  global Redux state.


  ### 6. Other Integrations

  Resources for integrating Redux with other ecosystems and libraries:

  - **Flux** – Tools and patterns bridging Redux and classic Flux architectures.

  - **Backbone** – Integration of Redux with Backbone models/collections.

  - **Falcor** – Patterns or tools to use Redux alongside Falcor.

  - **RxJS** – Reactive extensions and observable-based side-effect handling
  with Redux.

  - **Electron** – Using Redux in desktop apps built with Electron.

  - **Deku** – Integration patterns for the Deku UI library.

  - **Other** – Additional integrations beyond the major frameworks listed.


  ### 7. Boilerplate

  Boilerplates and scaffolding resources, including:

  - Starter kits and project templates for Redux apps

  - Generators and scaffolds

  - Preconfigured “stack ensembles” combining Redux with other tools (e.g.,
  React, routing, build systems)


  ### 8. Miscellaneous

  Additional Redux-related tools and resources that don’t fit neatly into the
  other categories.


  ### 9. Learning Material

  Educational content to understand and use Redux effectively:

  - **Redux Concepts** – Learning materials focused on Redux’s core principles
  and mental model, including the official Redux documentation.

  - **Immutable Data Structures** – Resources explaining immutable data, its
  importance, and its performance implications in UI frameworks such as React.

  - **Side Effects** – Guides and articles (e.g., Redux Loop’s README) that
  explain strategies for handling side effects in Redux.
