  # Awesome Golem


  A community-curated directory of tools, SDKs, projects, and learning resources
  around the Golem Network, a peer‑to‑peer marketplace for computational
  resources.


  ---


  ## Overview


  - **Type:** Themed directory / awesome list

  - **Focus:** Golem Network ecosystem

  - **Scope:** Tools, SDKs, projects, applications, stats, and learning
  materials for:
    - Providers (selling idle compute resources)
    - Requestors (buying compute to run tasks)
    - Developers building on Golem

  The list centers around Golem’s reference implementation, **Yagna** (Rust),
  which powers the P2P marketplace where participants can act as providers
  and/or requestors.
