## Overview
`meta-awesome: Entity` is a curated meta-directory that links to multiple "awesome" lists focused on entities—such as entity-component systems (ECS) and domain entities. It serves as a higher-level index so users can discover and navigate to more specialized, entity-related awesome lists hosted primarily on GitHub.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of awesome lists**
  - Aggregates links to third-party "awesome" lists centered on entities.
  - Provides a single entry point rather than searching for each list separately.

- **Entity-focused scope**
  - Targets topics like entity-component systems (ECS).
  - Includes lists related to domain entities and entity modeling.
  - Helps developers and researchers find resources specific to entity design and architecture.

- **GitHub-based curation**
  - Built as a Markdown document within the `meta-awesome` GitHub repository.
  - Leverages the broader awesome-list ecosystem and conventions (e.g., community-managed, open contributions).

- **Higher-level index structure**
  - Acts as an index of directories ("directory-of-directories").
  - Groups and organizes links so users can drill down from meta-level to specific awesome lists and then to individual projects/resources.

- **Open and extensible**
  - Hosted on GitHub, enabling community contributions via pull requests.
  - Can be expanded as new entity-related awesome lists are created.
