## Overview

The **NaturalLanguage** section of the **APD (Awesome Public Datasets) core** repository is a curated, Awesome-style sub-collection focused on **natural language processing (NLP) datasets and lexical resources**. Instead of hosting datasets directly, it acts as a **meta directory** that indexes multiple high‑quality external NLP resources through individual YAML metadata files.

Examples of referenced resources include:
- Question answering datasets (e.g., **SQuAD**)
- Syntactic and morphosyntactic corpora (e.g., **Universal Dependencies**)
- Lexical databases (e.g., **WordNet**)

This section follows the broader **Awesome ecosystem** pattern of providing a structured directory-of-resources to help users discover and navigate NLP datasets.

## Features

- **Curated NLP Dataset Index**  
  Focused list of public **natural language datasets and lexical resources**, filtered to highlight commonly used, higher-quality sources.

- **YAML-based Metadata Files**  
  Each dataset/resource is represented by an individual **YAML meta file** containing structured information (e.g., name, description, links, possibly licenses and modalities), enabling machine-readable indexing and easier tooling integration.

- **Meta Directory (Directory-of-Directories Pattern)**  
  Functions as a **directory of external resources**, not as a data host:
  - Links out to canonical dataset homepages or repositories.
  - Aligns with Awesome-style lists and the broader **Awesome Public Datasets (APD)** ecosystem.

- **Coverage of Multiple NLP Resource Types**  
  Includes various categories such as:
  - **Question answering** datasets (e.g., SQuAD)
  - **Parsed corpora / treebanks** (e.g., Universal Dependencies)
  - **Lexical/semantic resources** (e.g., WordNet)
  - Other written/spoken language datasets relevant to NLP research and applications.

- **Integration with APD Core Structure**  
  Lives under `core/NaturalLanguage` in the **apd-core** repo, benefiting from:
  - Shared conventions with other APD sub-collections.
  - Consistent metadata format across domains.

- **Open, Git-based Contribution Model**  
  As a GitHub-hosted collection, it can be extended via pull requests:
  - New YAML entries can be added for additional datasets.
  - Existing metadata can be updated or corrected collaboratively.

## Pricing

- **Free**  
  - Public GitHub repository.  
  - Free to browse, clone, and use the metadata and links to external datasets (subject to each dataset’s own license and access terms).
