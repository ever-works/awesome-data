  ## Overview

  Awesome AppImage is a curated, community-maintained list of tools,
  applications, and learning resources related to the AppImage format. It
  focuses on helping users discover AppImage-based software and assisting
  developers in creating, packaging, and distributing applications as single
  portable executables for Linux.


  ## Features


  ### 1. AppImage Discovery

  Resources to find and browse applications distributed as AppImages.


  #### App catalogs

  - **AppImage.GitHub.io** – Catalog of AppImages that have passed automated
  tests, with links to upstream project download pages.


  #### App stores

  - **AppImageHub.com** – Downloadable AppImages catalog, powered by
  Opendesktop.org.

  - **pling.com** – Open store for creators to publish libre products and
  creative content, including AppImages.

  - **Manjaro Software Discover** – Web-based app store listing applications in
  multiple formats, including AppImage.


  #### App centers

  - (Section exists in the list; includes desktop or distribution-level app
  centers that expose AppImages.)


  #### App scrapers

  - (Section exists; references tools/sites that scan and aggregate AppImage
  downloads from upstream projects.)


  ### 2. AppImage Consumption Tools

  Tools for end users to run, integrate, update, sandbox, and manage AppImages.


  #### Desktop integration

  - Tools that add menu entries, icons, MIME types, and desktop integration for
  downloaded AppImages.


  #### Updaters

  - Utilities and frameworks that support updating AppImages in place (e.g., via
  embedded update information).


  #### Sandboxes

  - Tools to run AppImages in isolated environments for improved security
  (sandboxing, confinement, etc.).


  #### Package managers

  - Command-line or graphical tools that treat AppImages as installable/managed
  packages.


  #### Linux distributions

  - Distributions that include or integrate AppImage support out of the box.


  ### 3. AppImage Developer Tools

  Tools and frameworks for building and packaging applications as AppImages.


  #### Low-level tools

  - Core utilities for creating, inspecting, and manipulating AppImage files.


  #### Build systems

  - Build-system integrations (e.g., CMake, other build tool plugins) that
  generate AppImages as build artifacts.


  #### Deployment tools for compiled applications

  - Tools that bundle compiled (C/C++ and similar) applications and their
  dependencies into AppImages.


  #### Deployment tools for Python applications

  - Packaging tools and workflows to convert Python applications into AppImages.


  #### Deployment tools for Electron applications

  - Solutions to package Electron-based desktop apps as AppImages.


  #### Deployment tools for Windows applications

  - Tools for wrapping or adapting Windows applications to run as AppImages
  (often via compatibility layers).


  #### Deployment tools for Java applications

  - Utilities to package JVM-based applications as AppImages.


  #### Deployment tools for .NET Core (Mono) applications

  - Tools for packaging .NET / Mono desktop apps as AppImages.


  #### Deployment tools for Flash applications

  - Historical/legacy tools to distribute Flash-based apps as AppImages.


  #### Deployment tools for Rust applications

  - Rust-oriented build/deploy tools that output AppImages.


  #### Tools to convert from other package formats

  - Converters and helpers to turn existing packages (e.g., deb/rpm/other) into
  AppImages.


  #### Metadata tools

  - Tools that help define, validate, and maintain AppImage metadata (desktop
  files, icons, update info, etc.).


  #### QC tools

  - Quality-control tools for testing, validation, and linting of AppImages.


  #### Continuous integration

  - CI integrations and templates for automatically building AppImages in CI
  pipelines.


  #### Libraries

  - Libraries and SDKs that provide programmatic interaction with AppImages or
  support embedding AppImage features.
