## Overview
Project Based Learning is an open-source, curated directory of programming tutorials where learners build complete applications from scratch. The tutorials are organized primarily by programming language and often combine multiple technologies and domains.

## Features
- **Curated tutorial list**
  - Focused on project-based tutorials rather than theory-only resources.
  - Emphasis on building full applications end-to-end.

- **Language-based organization**
  - Tutorials are grouped under primary programming languages (e.g., C#, C/C++, and many others listed in the README’s table of contents).
  - Each language section links to multiple project tutorials.

- **Multi-technology projects**
  - Many projects span more than one language or technology stack (e.g., combining frontend, backend, databases, APIs).

- **Hands-on learning focus**
  - Designed for aspiring software developers who want to learn by doing.
  - Encourages building real, working software rather than only reading or watching tutorials.

- **Open-source repository**
  - Hosted on GitHub.
  - Publicly accessible list: view, clone, or download without restrictions.
  - Includes standard project files such as `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `.travis.yml`, and `.github` configuration.

- **Contribution workflow**
  - Clear contribution guidelines provided in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Contributors can fork the repository and submit additions or improvements to the tutorial list.

- **Ecosystem signals (from GitHub)**
  - Widely used/open-source engagement: large number of stars and forks (as displayed on the GitHub page).
