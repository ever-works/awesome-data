**Slug:** `meta-awesome-hardware`

## Overview
Meta Awesome – Hardware is a curated subdirectory within the broader Meta Awesome project, focused on hardware-related resources. It aggregates links to existing hardware-focused “awesome lists” and similar collections, making it easier to discover tools, references, and learning materials across the hardware ecosystem.

## Features
- **Curated meta-directory**
  - Aggregates multiple hardware-related “awesome” lists and collections.
  - Central entry point to many disparate hardware resources.

- **Hardware-focused scope**
  - Concentrates specifically on hardware topics (e.g., electronics, embedded systems, devices, boards, tooling) as defined by the underlying lists.
  - Helps separate hardware content from software-only or general-topic awesome lists.

- **Integration with Meta Awesome**
  - Lives inside the larger Meta Awesome repository, which organizes many subject-specific meta-directories.
  - Benefits from a consistent structure and style used across the Meta Awesome project.

- **Reference-style resource listing**
  - Provides links out to external GitHub repositories, documentation, and other references.
  - Designed for browsing and discovery rather than being a standalone tool or service.

- **Open, GitHub-hosted format**
  - Implemented as a markdown document (`hardware.md`) in a public GitHub repo.
  - Can be viewed, forked, or cloned for personal customization or reuse.

## Use Cases
- Finding existing “awesome” collections focused on hardware.
- Using it as a starting point for learning about electronics, embedded systems, or hardware development.
- Referencing it to build or expand your own hardware-related awesome list or directory.

## Pricing
- Not a commercial product or service.
- Accessible for free as an open GitHub-hosted markdown document.
