  # Awesome WebGPU


  **Description**


  Awesome WebGPU is a curated GitHub list collecting resources, libraries,
  demos, and tools around WebGPU, the W3C JavaScript API for high‑performance
  GPU rendering and compute in modern browsers. It focuses on WebGPU itself, its
  shading language (WGSL), and the surrounding ecosystem for both 3D graphics
  and general GPU computing.

  ## Features


  ### 1. WebGPU Overview & Context

  - Explains WebGPU as a modern web standard from W3C for:
    - 3D graphics rendering in browsers
    - General GPU compute tasks in JavaScript environments
  - Clarifies that WebGPU:
    - Targets high performance on recent GPUs
    - Is designed for both desktop and mobile platforms
    - Is not a direct port of any native API
    - Borrows concepts from Metal, Vulkan, and Direct3D 12

  ### 2. Structured Content Sections

  The list is organized into multiple themed sections to help users quickly find
  resources:


  - **Websites**
    - Official WebGPU‑related websites
    - WebGPU specification pages
    - WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) specifications
    - API documentation sources
    - Miscellaneous WebGPU‑related sites and references

  - **Browser Support**
    - Overview that WebGPU is an experimental technology
    - **Chrome / Chromium‑based browsers**
      - Notes that Chrome and other Blink/Chromium browsers support WebGPU
    - **Firefox**
      - Indicates experimental support
      - Provides configuration flag:
        - `about:config`
        - `dom.webgpu.enabled`
    - **Safari**
      - Indicates experimental support
      - Provides feature‑flag path on Apple platforms:
        - `Settings` → `Safari` → `Advanced` → `Feature Flags` → `WebGPU`

  - **Articles**
    - Curated written content about WebGPU (blog posts, deep dives, overviews, etc.)

  - **Tutorials**
    - Learning resources for getting started and building with WebGPU

  - **Books**
    - Book‑length references and guides specific to WebGPU or closely related topics

  - **Libraries**
    - Libraries and frameworks that expose or build on WebGPU
    - May include JS/TS bindings, wrappers, rendering engines, and compute helpers

  - **Debuggers and Profilers**
    - Tools for debugging and profiling WebGPU code and performance
    - Notes that some listed tools “have not been updated for a while,” indicating maintenance status information

  - **Gists**
    - Small code snippets and examples hosted as gists, showcasing targeted WebGPU patterns and use cases

  - **Demos**
    - Example projects demonstrating WebGPU in practice
    - Notes that demos currently work best on Chrome/Edge

  - **Videos**
    - Video content such as talks, walkthroughs, and recorded tutorials about WebGPU

  - **Presentations**
    - Slides, conference talks, and other presentation materials related to WebGPU

  - **Community**
    - Links to community spaces where WebGPU is discussed (e.g., forums, chats, groups)

  - **Bug Reporting**
    - Pointers for where and how to report WebGPU or resource‑related issues

  ### 3. Contribution & Governance

  - **Contributions welcome**
    - Explicit invitation for community contributions
    - Dedicated `contributing.md` file outlining contribution steps and guidelines
  - **Code of Conduct**
    - `code-of-conduct.md` included, setting behavior expectations for contributors
  - **Repository Infrastructure**
    - Standard project files: `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `readme.md`, `license`
    - History of commits indicates ongoing maintenance and updates over time

  ### 4. Licensing

  - The maintainer, Mik Bry, has waived copyright and neighboring rights to this
  work to the extent permitted by law.

  - Effectively places the list into a public‑domain‑like status, allowing broad
  reuse and sharing.
