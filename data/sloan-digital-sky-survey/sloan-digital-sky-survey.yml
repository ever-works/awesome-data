  # Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)


  **Category:** Datasets  

  **Tags:** datasets, astronomy, physics  

  **Website:** http://www.sdss.org/


  Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a large-scale astronomical survey project
  providing public releases of imaging and spectroscopic data across the sky.
  Its datasets are widely used for research and education in astronomy,
  astrophysics, and cosmology.

  ## Features


  ### Survey & Coverage

  - Multi-epoch optical and infrared spectroscopy across the entire sky
  (SDSS-V).

  - Contiguous integral-field spectroscopic coverage of the Milky Way and Local
  Volume galaxies.

  - Long-running legacy of imaging and spectroscopic surveys spanning multiple
  SDSS phases (SDSS-I/II/III/IV/V).


  ### Current Data Release (DR19 – SDSS-V)

  - First major data release for SDSS-V.

  - Contains spectra and derived data products from:
    - **Black Hole Mapper (BHM)** – spectroscopic observations targeting black holes and active galactic nuclei.
    - **Milky Way Mapper (MWM)** – spectroscopic mapping of stars in the Milky Way.
    - **Local Volume Mapper (LVM)** – preview tile of the Helix Nebula and pathfinder data for mapping the interstellar medium and nearby galaxies.
  - Availability of:
    - **Value Added Catalogs (VACs)** with enhanced, derived parameters and curated data products.
    - **Tutorials** demonstrating how to access and work with DR19 data.
    - **Zora** visualization web application for interactive exploration of SDSS datasets (with associated tooling under “Zora and Valis”).
  - Detailed documentation and scientific description via the DR19 webpages and
  associated DR19 publication (linked on site).


  ### Previous Data Releases (SDSS-IV and earlier)

  All earlier SDSS data releases remain accessible, including completed surveys
  such as:

  - **Imaging and Legacy Survey** – large-scale optical imaging of the sky.

  - **Supernova Survey** – time-domain imaging and spectra of supernovae.

  - **SEGUE-1/SEGUE-2** – spectroscopic surveys of Milky Way stars for Galactic
  structure and stellar populations.

  - **MARVELS** – radial velocity survey focused on exoplanets and stellar
  companions.

  - **(e)BOSS** – Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and extended BOSS for
  large-scale structure and cosmology.

  - **APOGEE-1/APOGEE-2** – high-resolution infrared spectroscopy of Milky Way
  stars.

  - **MaNGA** – integral-field spectroscopy of nearby galaxies.

  - **MaStar** – stellar library for calibration and modeling.


  These earlier releases are available via:

  - SDSS “Completed Surveys” archive.

  - Dedicated SDSS-IV webpages, each with their own data-access tools and
  documentation.


  ### Data Access & Tools

  - Publicly accessible data releases, with web documentation and data portals
  (per data release).

  - Value Added Catalogs providing pre-processed, science-ready data products.

  - Tutorials for learning how to query, download, and analyze SDSS data.

  - Zora visualization web app for exploring spectra and catalogs (and related
  tools grouped under Zora/Valis).


  ### Roadmap

  - Next planned data release: **DR20**, scheduled for 2026.

  ## Use Cases

  - Research in cosmology, galaxy evolution, and large-scale structure.

  - Studies of black holes, active galactic nuclei, and quasar populations.

  - Milky Way structure, stellar populations, and chemical evolution.

  - Interstellar medium mapping in the Milky Way and the local volume of
  galaxies.

  - Education and training in astronomical data analysis using real survey data.
