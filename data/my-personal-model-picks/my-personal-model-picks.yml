  ## Overview


  My Personal Model Picks is a curated, Awesome-style directory of small,
  on-premise machine learning models. It focuses on models with strong practical
  utility that can be deployed locally, supporting privacy-friendly and
  bio-inspired applications.


  ## Features


  - **Curated model list**: Handpicked collection of machine learning models
  rather than an auto-generated index.

  - **Small, on-premise models**: Emphasis on models that can run locally on
  user hardware, avoiding heavy cloud dependencies.

  - **Practical utility focus**: Models are selected for real-world usefulness,
  not just benchmark performance.

  - **Privacy-centered deployment**: Highlights models suited for local,
  privacy-preserving workflows.

  - **Bio-inspired use cases**: Organized with attention to bio-inspired and
  related application domains.

  - **Awesome-style organization**: Structured as a browsable list, similar to
  typical “Awesome” collections.

  - **Open repository**: Public GitHub project with README and index.html for
  viewing and contribution.


  ## Pricing


  - **Free**: Open-source repository available at no cost.
