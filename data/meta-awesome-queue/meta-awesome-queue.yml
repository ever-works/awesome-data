  ## Overview
  Meta Awesome – Queue is a sublist within the Meta Awesome project that aggregates and curates “Awesome-style” lists and directories related to queuing systems, message brokers, and asynchronous processing. It serves as a meta-directory, pointing to multiple specialized Awesome lists rather than being a library or tool itself.
