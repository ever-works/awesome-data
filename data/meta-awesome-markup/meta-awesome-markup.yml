  Markdown (exact entries depend on the upstream list contents).

  (e.g., editors, converters, linters, processors – as provided by the list).

  - **Markup-related resources**: Links to learning materials, documentation,
  and other resources centered on markup technologies.

  - **GitHub-hosted document**: Distributed as a single `markup.md` file within
  the Meta Awesome repository for easy browsing and contributions.
