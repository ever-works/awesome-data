  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** functional-programming, programming-languages, resources


  ## Overview


  Awesome Functional Programming is a GitHub-based, community-maintained
  directory that aggregates educational and reference material related to
  functional programming. It is inspired by the broader
  [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/) list ecosystem.


  The list is intended for developers, students, and researchers interested in
  learning, practicing, or deepening their understanding of functional
  programming concepts, tools, and ecosystems.


  ## Features

    - Collects high-quality links and references specifically focused on functional programming.
    - Emphasizes educational and theoretical foundations as well as practical tooling.

  - **Multiple Content Types**
    - **Blog Posts** – Articles and series covering concepts, techniques, and real-world usage of functional programming.
    - **Papers** – Academic and research publications for deeper theoretical understanding.
    - **Wikis** – Community-maintained knowledge bases and reference material.
    - **Books** – Learning paths and in-depth resources, from introductory to advanced.

    - **Videos** – Talks, lectures, and video tutorials (section referenced in the table of contents).

  - **Focus on Theory and Practice**
    - Aims to clarify theoretical subjects in functional programming (e.g., core concepts, paradigms, and formal foundations).
    - Includes practical resources such as tools and language ecosystems.

  - **Open Contribution Model**
    - Hosted on GitHub, allowing contributions via pull requests.
    - A dedicated `contributing.md` guides how to propose new entries or changes.
