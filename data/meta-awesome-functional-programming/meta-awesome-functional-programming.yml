  # Meta Awesome – Functional Programming

  **Website:** https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/functional-programming.md

  ## Overview
  Meta Awesome – Functional Programming is a curated "meta-awesome" document that aggregates multiple awesome lists focused on functional programming. It acts as a directory of high-quality, community-maintained resources related to functional programming languages, paradigms, tools, and ecosystems.

  ## Category
  - Meta-directories

  ## Tags
  - Meta-directory
  - Functional-programming
  - Awesome-lists

  ## Features
  - **Meta-aggregation of awesome lists**  
    Collects links to many separate awesome lists that focus specifically on functional programming.

  - **Coverage of functional programming languages**  
    Points to awesome lists and resources for various functional programming languages and language ecosystems.

  - **Paradigms and concepts focused**  
    Organizes resources around functional programming paradigms, practices, and core concepts (e.g., immutability, higher-order functions, pure functions, type systems), as represented in the underlying awesome lists.

  - **Ecosystem and tooling directories**  
    Includes links to awesome lists covering tooling, libraries, and frameworks commonly used in functional programming ecosystems.

  - **Community-curated resources**  
    Leverages the "awesome list" format from GitHub, meaning the referenced lists are typically community-maintained, open, and version-controlled.

  - **Central entry point for exploration**  
    Serves as a single starting page for discovering many functional-programming-related awesome lists instead of searching for them individually.

  - **Markdown-based document**  
    Provided as a markdown file within the GitHub repository, making it easy to browse directly on GitHub or reuse in other markdown-based contexts.

  ## Pricing
  - Not applicable (open GitHub document / directory of links).
