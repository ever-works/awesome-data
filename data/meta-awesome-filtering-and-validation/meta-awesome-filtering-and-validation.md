## Overview
meta-awesome: Filtering and Validation is a curated "directory of directories" collecting Awesome-style lists that focus on data filtering, input validation, and closely related libraries, tools, and frameworks. It serves as a meta-index to help developers discover specialized Awesome lists in this domain rather than individual libraries directly.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of Awesome lists**
  - Aggregates multiple Awesome-style lists centered on filtering and validation.
  - Focuses on directories rather than single projects.

- **Scope: Filtering & Validation**
  - Targets resources on input validation, data filtering, sanitization, and similar concerns.
  - Helps locate language-specific and framework-specific lists for validation tooling.

- **GitHub-hosted document**
  - Implemented as a Markdown document within the `meta-awesome` repository.
  - Easy to browse, fork, or contribute to using standard GitHub workflows.

- **Community-driven curation**
  - Open to contributions via pull requests.
  - Aligns with the broader Awesome-list ecosystem’s conventions and style.

## Contents (Conceptual)
While the full list is contained in the GitHub document itself, the meta-awesome: Filtering and Validation page is expected to include:
- Links to Awesome lists focused on:
  - General-purpose validation and filtering libraries.
  - Web form validation.
  - API request/response validation.
  - Data sanitization and normalization.
  - Security-related validation (e.g., protecting against injection via validation).
- Each entry typically includes:
  - Repository or website link.
  - Brief description of the list’s focus.

## Use Cases
- Finding curated Awesome lists for:
  - Choosing validation libraries for a specific programming language.
  - Researching best practices in data filtering and input validation.
  - Exploring ecosystem tools for secure data handling.

## Pricing
- Access is **free** (standard open-source GitHub repository).
