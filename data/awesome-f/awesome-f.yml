  ## Features


  ### Scope and Coverage

  - Curated catalog of F# tools, libraries, and frameworks

  - Includes F#-specific software projects

  - Collects educational and learning resources for F#

  - Focuses on functional-first programming on .NET and related platforms


  ### Main Language-Related Repositories

  - Dedicated section listing primary F# language-related repositories (e.g.,
  compiler, core tooling, or foundational projects; specific repos not fully
  visible in provided content but organized under this heading)


  ### F# Wrappers for Popular .NET Libraries

  A cross-reference table mapping common .NET libraries to F#-friendly wrappers:


  - **Web and UI frameworks**
    - **ASP.NET Core Blazor → Bolero**  
      - F# wrapper around ASP.NET Core Blazor components
    - **ASP.NET Core → Giraffe**  
      - F#-friendly web framework on top of ASP.NET Core  
      - Optional integration with **Saturn** (opinionated F# web framework)  
      - Also lists **Oxpecker** as another F# option for ASP.NET Core
    - **Avalonia UI → Avalonia.FuncUI**  
      - F# functional UI abstraction over the Avalonia cross-platform UI framework
    - **MAUI / Xamarin.Forms → Fabulous**  
      - F# framework for building mobile/desktop apps on .NET MAUI or Xamarin.Forms

  - **Testing frameworks**
    - **MSTest / NUnit / xUnit.net → FsUnit**  
      - F#-focused assertion and testing helpers usable with popular .NET test runners

  - **Serialization and runtime libraries**
    - Mentions integration with **System.Text.Json** (partial text shown) via F#-oriented wrappers/utilities (exact project name truncated in the provided content but listed in the same wrapper table)

  ### Repository Structure and Governance

  - Includes **CONTRIBUTING.md** with contribution guidelines for adding and
  maintaining entries

  - Includes **ARCHIVE.md** for archived or deprecated items

  - Licensed via **LICENSE.txt** (open-source / documentation license; exact
  terms in the file)

  - Automated workflows located under **.github/workflows** (e.g., for
  validation or CI on list changes)

  - Supporting **scripts** folder for repository maintenance tasks (such as
  formatting, validation, or generation of sections)


  ### Curation Characteristics

  - Emphasizes “awesome” / high-quality F# resources rather than exhaustive
  listing

  - Organized into sections (e.g., “Main Language-Related Repositories,”
  wrappers table, and other content headings not fully visible in the snippet)
  for easier discovery

  - Targets both practical development (frameworks, libraries, wrappers) and
  learning (educational resources)
