## Overview
Web Framework is a section of the `meta-awesome` collection that catalogs curated “awesome lists” related to web frameworks and closely associated web technologies. Instead of being a framework itself, it acts as an index or hub that points developers to specialized awesome lists covering frameworks, servers, and tooling across the web stack.

## Features
- **Awesome list index for web frameworks**  
  Centralizes links to multiple awesome lists focused on web frameworks, so developers can discover framework-specific resources from a single place.

- **Coverage of web servers and infrastructure**  
  Includes references to awesome lists for web servers and related infrastructure that support or complement web frameworks.

- **Tools and utilities directory**  
  Points to curated lists of tools, utilities, and supporting technologies relevant to building, running, and maintaining web applications.

- **Related web topics**  
  Extends beyond core frameworks to encompass other web development topics, helping users explore broader areas of the web ecosystem.

- **Part of a larger meta-awesome collection**  
  Integrated into `meta-awesome`, a higher-level index of many topic-specific awesome lists, giving users a path to discover additional domains beyond web frameworks.

- **Developer-focused resource hub**  
  Serves as a discovery aid for developers seeking high-quality, community-maintained lists rather than individual tools or libraries.
