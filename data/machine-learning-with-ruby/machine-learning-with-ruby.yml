  # Machine Learning with Ruby


  > Curated list of resources for learning, implementing, and applying machine
  learning using the Ruby programming language.


  ## Overview


  Machine Learning with Ruby is an "awesome list" style, community-maintained
  directory of Ruby-focused machine learning resources. It aggregates libraries,
  tutorials, data sources, articles, and example projects that show how to
  perform machine learning and related computational science tasks with Ruby.


  Category: Themed directories  

  Tags: Ruby, Machine Learning, Awesome Lists


  ## Features


  ### Scope and Content

  - Curated collection specifically focused on **machine learning with Ruby**.

  - Emphasizes practical applications of ML within the Ruby ecosystem.

  - Includes resources originating from:
    - The Ruby Science Foundation (SciRuby)
    - Community contributors
    - Real-world ML application work by maintainers and contributors

  ### Resource Types

  The list is organized into multiple sections to help users find relevant
  material quickly:


  - **✨ Tutorials**  
    Step-by-step learning materials and guides for getting started and advancing with machine learning in Ruby.

    Links to community hubs, discussion channels, and organizations (including SciRuby) connected to Ruby ML.

  - **Related Resources**  
    Additional links to resources adjacent to Ruby ML (e.g., Ruby data science, Ruby NLP, interoperability with other ecosystems).

  ### Organization and Navigation

  - Clearly structured **table of contents** with anchored sections.

  - Each section groups related links, libraries, and references for targeted
  exploration.

  - Part of the broader "awesome" ecosystem and follows common awesome-list
  conventions.


  ### Community and Contributions
