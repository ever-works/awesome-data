    - Image modality or type (e.g., MRI, CT, digital histopathology).
    - Specific research focus.
  - Primary imaging file format: **DICOM** for radiology imaging.

  - Supporting data may include (when available):
    - Patient outcomes.
    - Treatment details.
    - Genomic data.
    - Expert analyses and annotations.
