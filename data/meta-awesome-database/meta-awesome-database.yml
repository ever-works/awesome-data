  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Database is a focused index of database-related "awesome"
  lists. It aggregates and organizes curated GitHub lists that cover
  general-purpose databases, database concepts, and related tools, acting as a
  directory-of-directories for database resources.


  ## Features

  - **Meta index for database awesome lists**  
    Serves as a central entry point to multiple specialized "awesome" lists dedicated to databases.

  - **Coverage of general-purpose databases**  
    Links to lists that focus on mainstream relational and non-relational database systems.

  - **Concept-focused resources**  
    Includes references to lists that cover core database concepts such as design, modeling, theory, and internals (as available in linked awesome lists).

  - **Tools and ecosystem listings**  
    Points to curated lists of tools used with databases (e.g., clients, ORMs, admin tools, migration tools) where those are covered by the underlying awesome lists.

  - **Specialized subdomains of databases**  
    Acts as an entry point into more niche or specialized database awesome lists (e.g., specific DB engines, analytical databases, or related infrastructure) when those lists are referenced.

  - **GitHub-native structure**  
    Implemented as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, fork, or contribute via pull requests.

  - **Part of the broader Meta Awesome collection**  
    One section within the wider `meta-awesome` project, which organizes meta-lists for many domains beyond databases.

  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. This is a free, open GitHub directory of links to
  database-related awesome lists.
