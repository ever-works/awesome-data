  # Awesome WordPress-Gatsby


  **Type:** Curated resource list (Awesome list)  

  **Category:** Themed directories / JAMstack, Web Development, CMS  

  **Stack Focus:** WordPress (headless CMS) + Gatsby (Static Site Generator)


  ## Overview

  Awesome WordPress-Gatsby is a curated collection of links and resources for
  building sites using WordPress as a headless CMS and Gatsby as the static
  front end. It focuses on architectures where WordPress exposes content via
  APIs (REST or GraphQL) and Gatsby consumes that content to generate fast,
  static HTML/CSS/JS sites.


  ## Features

  - **Curated resources for WordPress + Gatsby stack**  
    - Focuses specifically on using WordPress as a headless CMS and Gatsby as a static site generator.
  - **Coverage of headless CMS concepts**  
    - Explains the idea of a back-end–only CMS exposing content via APIs (REST/GraphQL).
  - **Coverage of Static Site Generator concepts**  
    - Describes SSGs as tools/frameworks for generating static websites from various data sources (local files, REST, GraphQL, etc.).
  - **Repository structure for community contributions**  
    - Includes README, license, code of conduct, and contributing guidelines to organize and grow the list.
  - **WordPress-oriented content**  
    - Targets developers who want to keep WordPress’ content authoring workflow while decoupling the front end.
  - **Gatsby-oriented content**  
    - Focus on using Gatsby as a performance-oriented front-end for WordPress-powered content.

  *(The underlying list typically includes starters, plugins, guides, articles,
