- **Libraries and SDKs** – Links to implementation libraries and toolkits that help add RTC functionality to applications.
- **Tools and utilities** – Collection of tools for testing, debugging, and operating RTC systems.
- **Developer-focused** – Oriented toward engineers and developers who need technical references and building blocks for RTC solutions.
- **Near-simultaneous exchange focus** – Emphasis on technologies that support low-latency, bidirectional media and data transfer.

## Pricing
- Not applicable. Awesome RTC is an open, GitHub-hosted curated list and does not advertise pricing or paid plans.
