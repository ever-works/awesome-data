  - **Libraries and SDKs** – Links to implementation libraries and toolkits that
  help add RTC functionality to applications.

  - **Tools and utilities** – Collection of tools for testing, debugging, and
  operating RTC systems.

  - **Developer-focused** – Oriented toward engineers and developers who need
  technical references and building blocks for RTC solutions.

  - **Near-simultaneous exchange focus** – Emphasis on technologies that support
  low-latency, bidirectional media and data transfer.
