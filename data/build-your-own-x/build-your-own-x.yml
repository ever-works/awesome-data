  ## Description


  “Build your own X” is an open-source, awesome-style collection of links to
  detailed guides, blog posts, and repositories that show how to implement
  various technologies from the ground up. It focuses on practical, from-scratch
  implementations as a way to deeply understand concepts in systems programming,
  computer science, and software engineering.

  ## Features


  ### 1. Curated tutorial collection

  - Aggregates **well‑written, step‑by‑step guides** from across the web.  

  - Emphasis on **recreating real technologies** rather than toy examples.  

  - Acts as a **meta-directory** pointing to high‑quality external resources.


  ### 2. Wide range of technology categories

  The repository groups tutorials under many “Build your own …” themes,
  including:


  - **3D Renderer** – Implementing basic rendering engines and pipelines.

  - **Augmented Reality** – Building simple AR systems and demos.

  - **BitTorrent Client** – Creating peer‑to‑peer file sharing clients.

  - **Blockchain / Cryptocurrency** – Implementing blockchains, consensus, and
  coins.

  - **Bot** – Building automation and chat bots.

  - **Command-Line Tool** – Writing CLI utilities and toolchains.

  - **Database** – Implementing storage engines, query processors, and DB
  internals.

  - **Docker** – Recreating containerization primitives and tools.

  - **Emulator / Virtual Machine** – Building CPU/console emulators and VMs.

  - **Front-end Framework / Library** – Rolling your own UI or component
  framework.

  - **Game** – Game engine or small game implementations.

  - **Git** – Implementing version control system concepts.

  - **Network Stack** – Building networking layers and protocols.

  - **Neural Network** – Implementing neural nets and learning algorithms from
  scratch.

  - **Operating System** – Simple OS kernels and system components.

  - **Physics Engine** – Basic physics and collision systems.

  - **Programming Language** – Writing interpreters, compilers, or DSLs.

  - **Regex Engine** – Implementing pattern matching engines.

  - **Search Engine** – Indexing and search from the ground up.

  - **Shell** – Creating Unix‑like command shells.

  - **Template Engine** – Implementing text/template rendering engines.

  - **Text Editor** – Building editors with buffers, cursors, and commands.

  - **Visual Recognition System** – Image recognition and CV pipelines.

  - **Voxel Engine** – Minecraft‑style voxel renderers.

  - **Web Browser** – Layout, rendering, and networking for browsers.

  - **Web Server** – Implementing HTTP servers and request handling. *(truncated
  in source, but implied by `Web Serve`)*


  > Note: The actual README typically includes multiple links per category,
  often across different programming languages.


  ### 3. Learning-focused approach

  - Inspired by the idea *“What I cannot create, I do not understand”*
  (Feynman).  

  - Encourages **hands-on learning** by rebuilding systems rather than reading
  theory alone.

  - Useful for **self‑study**, **portfolio projects**, and **deep dives into
  internals**.


  ### 4. Open-source GitHub repository

  - Public GitHub repo (forkable and clonable).  

  - Standard files (e.g., `README.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, `.gitattributes`).  

  - Community‑driven: users can typically propose new resources via issues/PRs.
