## Overview
Awesome Google Cloud is a curated, community-maintained directory of applications, tools, libraries, examples, and learning resources for building on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It aggregates high-quality GitHub projects and references related to various Google Cloud services.

## Features
- **Curated awesome list:** Focused specifically on the Google Cloud ecosystem, following the conventions of the broader "awesome" list community.
- **Coverage of Google Cloud services:** Includes resources spanning major GCP areas such as:
  - **General** Google Cloud resources (high-level references, getting started materials, and common tooling).
  - **Compute** services, including:
    - **App Engine** – examples and tools for building and deploying on App Engine (section present in the list, with projects linked in the repo).
    - **Cloud Functions** – libraries and tools for serverless functions, such as:
      - **Functions Framework** – open-source libraries for writing portable Google Cloud functions.
      - **Goblet** – an open-source library for building serverless Python applications on Google Cloud Functions.
