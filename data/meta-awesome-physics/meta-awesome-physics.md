## Overview
Meta Awesome - Physics is an "Awesome-style" meta list that aggregates curated Awesome directories and other resource lists focused on physics. It serves as a central index pointing to multiple specialized lists covering physics topics, educational resources, and scientific tools.

## Features
- **Meta index of physics lists**
  - Collects and organizes links to multiple Awesome lists and curated directories specifically about physics.
  - Helps users discover physics-related resources without searching across many separate lists.

- **Coverage of physics disciplines** *(inferred from description)*
  - Oriented around general physics topics (e.g., theoretical, experimental, applied physics).
  - Likely includes subfields such as classical mechanics, quantum physics, relativity, astrophysics, and related areas where dedicated lists exist.

- **Educational materials focus**
  - Highlights lists that contain tutorials, lecture notes, textbooks, and learning resources for students and educators.
  - Points to resources suitable for self-study and formal education.

- **Scientific tools and software**
  - Aggregates lists that cover physics-oriented software, libraries, and tools (e.g., simulation frameworks, data analysis libraries, numerical computing tools).

- **Awesome-inspired structure**
  - Follows the conventional "Awesome" list style (Markdown-based, link-driven, community-curated).
  - Designed to be extended and maintained via GitHub contributions.

- **Open and collaborative**
  - Hosted on GitHub, allowing users to suggest additions, corrections, or improvements through issues and pull requests.

## Pricing
- Not applicable. This is an open, GitHub-hosted meta list of links and resources, with no pricing or plans indicated.
