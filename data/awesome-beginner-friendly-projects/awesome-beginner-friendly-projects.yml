  # Awesome Beginner-Friendly Projects


  An open-source directory of projects that are explicitly beginner- and
  first-time-contributor-friendly.


  ---


  ## Overview


  **Awesome Beginner-Friendly Projects** is a curated GitHub list focused on
  open-source repositories that welcome newcomers. Projects typically use labels
  such as `first-timers-only` (or similar) to highlight issues suitable for a
  contributor’s first pull request.


  The list is part of the broader
  [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) ecosystem and
  is inspired by the *First Timers Only* initiative.
