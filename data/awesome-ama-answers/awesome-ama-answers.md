## Description
Awesome AMA Answers is a curated directory of insightful questions and answers taken from developer “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) sessions on GitHub. It organizes standout responses so they’re easier to browse and reference.

## Features
- **Curated AMA answers**: Collects notable, high-signal answers from various GitHub AMAs rather than full threads.
- **Question–answer pairing**: Each entry clearly shows the original question, the person who asked it, and a direct link to the answer.
- **Attribution to authors**: Every answer is attributed to the AMA host who responded (with GitHub profile links).
- **Deep links to original issues**: Answers link back to the specific GitHub issue comment where the AMA response was posted.
- **Developer-focused topics**: Current examples include questions on:
  - The future of the web (e.g., “How will the web look in 10 years?”)
  - One-line Node.js modules
  - Opinions on Python
  - Handling low-quality GitHub issues
  - How to “do” open source
  - Thoughts on PostCSS
  - What might come after JavaScript
  - Light‑hearted/personal questions (e.g., beard grooming)
- **Part of the Awesome ecosystem**: Follows the style and conventions of the broader `awesome-*` lists (inspired by sindresorhus/awesome).
- **Contributions welcomed**: Includes a `contributing.md` file to guide adding new AMA answers to the list.
- **Focused, text-based list**: Provided primarily via a single README for quick scanning and minimal overhead.
