  ## Description

  Awesome Neovim is a curated, community-maintained directory of Neovim plugins,
  configurations, and related resources. It focuses on plugins that leverage
  Neovim-specific features rather than generic Vim-compatible plugins.


  ## Features

  - **Neovim-focused curation**
    - Only lists plugins and tools that specifically target Neovim functionality.
    - Excludes generic Vim-compatible plugins where they are not Neovim-specific.

  - **Organized by functionality** (examples visible in the content)
    - **Plugin Managers**
      - Entries such as `wbthomason/packer.nvim`, `lazy.nvim`, `vim.pack`, `mini.nvim`.
    - **LSP (Language Server Protocol)**
      - Focus on Neovim’s built-in LSP (requires Neovim 0.5+).
      - Mentions of tools and features around:
        - `lsp_signature`
        - `textDocument/codeAction`
        - `symbols-outline.nvim`
        - `vim.diagnostic`
        - Various language server setups (e.g., `pyright`).
      - Sections for:
        - **LSP Installer** (for managing language server installations).
        - **Diagnostics** (tools and helpers for displaying and interacting with diagnostics).
    - **Completion**
      - Autocompletion plugins and related tooling, including:
        - `nvim-compe`
        - `nvim-cmp` (with multiple sources and integrations listed)
        - `LuaSnip` (snippet engine integration)
        - `mini.nvim` (minimal Lua-based modules including completion-related parts)
        - `blink.cmp` / `blink-cmp` and related sources (e.g., integration with `ripgrep`, `git grep`, `.env`, `sshconfig`).
    - **AI**
      - AI-assisted tooling integrations mentioning backends like:
        - `PaLM`
        - `Hugging Face`
        - `llamacpp` / `llama.cpp`.

  - **Neovim ecosystem overview**
    - Links out to the main Neovim project.
    - Positions itself within the broader "Awesome" list ecosystem (conforms to awesome.re style and standards).

  - **Repository structure for contributions**
    - Standard community files present (from repository listing):
      - `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines.
      - `MAINTAINERS.md` for maintainer information.
