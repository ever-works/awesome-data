  # Awesome Biomedical Information Extraction

  A curated **Awesome List** focused on methods, tools, and resources for extracting structured information from unstructured biomedical data and text (e.g., clinical notes, scientific articles, biological data reports). It emphasizes freely available, publicly accessible, and actively maintained resources.

  ---

  ## Overview

  **BioIE (Biomedical Information Extraction)** covers techniques and resources for transforming unstructured or inconsistently structured biomedical, clinical, or biological data into structured information and, ultimately, knowledge. Typical sources include:

  - Technical biomedical and clinical text documents
  - Biological research literature
  - Other biomedical data with weak or inconsistent structure

  The field has evolved rapidly with the advent of language models such as BERT and modern LLMs (e.g., GPT‑3/4, LLaMA 2/3, Gemini), requiring adaptations of general NLP methods to biomedical-specific data and vocabularies.

  The list is part of the broader Awesome ecosystem and is related to:
  - [awesome-nlp](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp)
  - [awesome-biology](https://github.com/raivivek/awesome-biology)
  - [Awesome-Bioinformatics](https://github.com/danielecook/Awesome-Bioinformatics)

     Research labs, academic groups, and industry teams focusing on biomedical information extraction, text mining, and related NLP.

  3. **Organizations**  
     Professional bodies, consortia, and initiatives relevant to biomedical text mining, clinical NLP, and structured knowledge extraction.

  4. **Journals and Events**
     - **Journals** that frequently publish work on BioIE, clinical NLP, biomedical text mining, and related methods.
     - **Conferences and Other Events** such as workshops, symposia, and meetings in biomedical NLP and information extraction.
     - **Challenges** (shared tasks and competitions) providing benchmark tasks, datasets, and evaluation frameworks for BioIE.

  5. **Tutorials**
     - **Guides**: Written tutorials and step‑by‑step introductions to biomedical IE, annotation, model training, and evaluation.
     - **Video Lectures and Online Courses**: Recorded lectures, MOOCs, and course series covering biomedical text mining and IE methods.

  6. **Code Libraries**
     - General-purpose **codebases and libraries** for biomedical NLP, information extraction, and text processing.
     - **Repositories for specific datasets**, providing code tailored to particular corpora or benchmark tasks.

  7. **Tools, Platforms, and Services**
     - General **BioIE tools and platforms** used for pipeline construction, text mining, concept recognition, and relation extraction.
     - **Annotation Tools** for creating labeled corpora (e.g., entity and relation annotations), supporting the development of supervised models.

  8. **Techniques and Models**
     - Methods, architectures, and model families specialized for biomedical IE, including:
       - Traditional machine learning approaches
       - Neural sequence models and transformers
       - Domain‑specific pre‑trained language models
       - LLM-based workflows for extraction, summarization, and reasoning

  9. **Datasets**
     A broad collection of datasets used to train and evaluate BioIE systems, including:

     - **Biomedical Text Sources**: Unlabeled or weakly structured corpora (e.g., biomedical literature, clinical text sources) used for pretraining or unsupervised methods.
     - **Annotated Text Data**: Corpora annotated for tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction, and document classification.
     - **Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Annotated Corpora**: Specialized datasets for extracting and analyzing protein‑protein interaction information from text.
     - **Other Datasets**: Additional domain-specific corpora that support niche BioIE tasks (e.g., pharmacovigilance, gene–disease relations, pathways).

  10. **Ontologies and Controlled Vocabularies**
      - Links to standardized biomedical ontologies and vocabularies that underpin concept normalization, semantic interoperability, and knowledge graph construction in BioIE workflows.

  11. **Data Models**
      - References to data schemas, interchange formats, and modeling standards used to represent extracted biomedical information consistently across systems.

  12. **Credits**
      - Acknowledgment of maintainers, contributors, and source projects that support the list.
