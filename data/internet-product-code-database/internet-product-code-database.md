## Internet Product Code Database

**Directory type:** Themed data/dataset directory  
**Category:** Themed Directories  
**Slug:** `internet-product-code-database`

### Overview
Internet Product Code Database is an open, community‑driven directory of Universal Product Codes (UPCs) and associated product information. It is cited in the *Awesome Public Datasets* (economics section) as a resource for product‑level identifiers that can be joined to retail, trade, and pricing datasets.

### Features
- **Open, community‑driven data**: Contributions from the community to expand and refine UPC coverage and product records.
- **UPC / EAN identifiers**: Focus on Universal Product Codes and related product‑level identifiers suitable for linking across datasets.
- **Product information lookup**: Provides descriptive product information associated with UPCs (e.g., name/label and related attributes when available).
- **Research‑oriented**: Referenced as an economics/public dataset resource, intended for linking with retail, trade, and pricing datasets.
- **Directory‑style resource**: Acts as a structured index of product‑level identifiers rather than a single monolithic file, facilitating selective use and integration.

### Use Cases
- Joining UPC‑level product data to retail scanner, sales, or pricing datasets.
- Building or enriching ecommerce catalogs with standardized product identifiers.
- Economic and market‑structure research requiring consistent product‑level keys.
