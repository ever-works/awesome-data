  # Meta Awesome – Native Implemented Functions

  **Category:** Meta Directories  
  **Tags:** meta-directory, low-level, programming  
  **Source:** <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/native-implemented-functions.md>

  ## Overview
  Meta Awesome – Native Implemented Functions is a curated document within the `meta-awesome` project that aggregates “awesome lists” related to native implemented functions (NIFs) and other low-level language/runtime integrations. It serves as a higher-level index pointing to existing collections rather than duplicating their contents.

  ## Features
  - **Meta-directory of lists**
    - Collects and links to multiple “awesome” lists focused on native implemented functions and low-level integrations.
    - Acts as a central reference point for discovering specialized resources.

  - **Focus on native / low-level integration**
    - Emphasizes native implemented functions (NIFs) and bridges between high-level languages and low-level code (e.g., C, system libraries, runtimes).
    - Targets topics like performance-critical extensions, FFI (foreign function interfaces), and runtime interoperability.

  - **Part of the `meta-awesome` project**
    - Integrated into a broader collection of meta-lists that index awesome lists across many domains.
    - Follows the common “awesome list” ecosystem style and structure (markdown-based, link-centric).

  - **Open, extensible document**
    - Hosted on GitHub, allowing contributions via pull requests.
    - Can be extended as new awesome lists or low-level integration resources appear.

  ## Contents (High-Level)
  - Links to existing awesome lists focused on:
    - Native implemented functions and extensions for various languages.
    - Low-level integrations, FFI bindings, and system-level programming resources.
  - Short contextual descriptions per linked list (where provided in the source document).

  ## Pricing
  - Not a commercial product or service.  
  - Publicly available as an open GitHub document with no pricing or paid plans.
