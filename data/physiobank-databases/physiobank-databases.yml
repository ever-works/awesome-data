  **Provider / Brand:** PhysioNet  

  **Tags:** datasets, healthcare, biosignals


  ## Overview

  PhysioBank is a large and continuously growing archive of physiologic signal
  databases hosted by PhysioNet. It focuses on ECG, EEG, and related biosignals,
  and is widely used in healthcare and biomedical research. Many of its
  resources are referenced in public dataset collections, including the Awesome
  Public Datasets healthcare list.


  ## Features

  - **Extensive physiologic signal archive**  
    - Collections of ECG (electrocardiogram), EEG (electroencephalogram), and other biosignal recordings.  
    - Databases oriented toward healthcare, clinical research, and physiological signal analysis.

  - **Multiple access types**  
    - Openly accessible databases.  
    - Credentialed-access databases for sensitive or linked health information (e.g., some Bridge2AI-Voice datasets).

  - **Research-grade datasets**  
    - Designed for use in biomedical research, data science, and AI/ML model development.  
    - Includes datasets linked to health information and questionnaire responses (for specific voice-related resources).

  - **Specialized collections (examples from site content)**  
    - Bridge2AI-Voice Pediatric Dataset: questionnaire responses, spectrograms, and other information for pediatric participants in the "voice as a biomarker of health" project (credentialed access).  
    - Bridge2AI-Voice: diverse voice dataset linked to health information, ethically sourced and requiring credentialed access.

  - **Versioned datasets**  
    - Datasets are published with explicit versions (e.g., v1.0.0, v3.0.0) and publication dates to support reproducible research.

  - **Rich metadata and documentation**  
    - Each database is accompanied by descriptive information about data contents and structure (e.g., topics like voice, Bridge2AI) to help users find appropriate resources.

  - **Integration within PhysioNet ecosystem**  
    - Directly accessible through the PhysioNet platform, alongside tools, resources, and related content for physiologic signal processing.

  ## Pricing

  - No explicit pricing information is provided in the available content. Some
  datasets require credentialed access but cost or fee details are not
  specified.
