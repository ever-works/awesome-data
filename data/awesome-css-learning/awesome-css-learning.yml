  ## Overview


  Awesome CSS Learning is a curated GitHub directory focused specifically on
  learning CSS as a language and its official modules. It collects high‑quality
  learning resources and references for understanding core CSS concepts, rather
  than tools or frameworks around CSS.


  The list explicitly centers on:

  - CSS language fundamentals

  - CSS modules and specifications

  - Practical learning materials for improving CSS skills


  It deliberately excludes topics like naming conventions, architecture
  paradigms, frameworks, preprocessors, postprocessors, and CSS‑in‑JS.
