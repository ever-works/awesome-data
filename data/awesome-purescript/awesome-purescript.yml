  ## Overview


  Awesome PureScript is a community-maintained directory of high-quality
  PureScript libraries, tools, and learning resources. It is structured as an
  "awesome list" on GitHub and aims to help developers quickly discover useful
  components and tooling in the PureScript ecosystem.


  Repository: https://github.com/passy/awesome-purescript

  ## Features


  ### 1. Curated Libraries and Tools

  - Organizes noteworthy libraries and tools from the PureScript ecosystem.

  - Focuses on well-regarded, actively used, or otherwise notable projects.

  - Includes links directly to project repositories or documentation.


  ### 2. Build Tooling Section

  Lists build-related tools for managing, compiling, and integrating PureScript
  in projects, including (examples from the content):

  - **pulp** – General-purpose build tool for PureScript projects.

  - **psvm-js** – PureScript Version Manager for handling PureScript compiler
  versions.

  - **purescript-psa** – Pretty, flexible error/warning reporting frontend for
  the `psc` compiler.

  - **grunt-purescript** – Grunt plugin for compiling PureScript.

  - **gulp-purescript** – Gulp plugin for compiling PureScript.

  - **purs-loader** – Webpack loader for integrating PureScript into Webpack
  builds.

  - **psc-package** – Package manager for PureScript (mentioned in truncated
  link).


  > Note: The README contains additional sections beyond Build Tooling (e.g.,
  libraries by domain, learning resources, editor tooling, etc.), but these are
  not fully visible in the provided content. The list is structured to cover
  multiple aspects of PureScript development.


  ### 3. Structured as an Awesome List

  - Follows the standard GitHub *awesome-list* format.

  - Includes a badge via sindresorhus/awesome, indicating it adheres to curation
  guidelines.

  - Organized into thematic sections (e.g., build tooling, libraries by
  category, etc.) for easy navigation.


  ### 4. Community Contribution

  - Provides a `contributing.md` file with contribution guidelines (how to
  propose additions or changes).

  - Maintained as an open-source GitHub repository, allowing the community to
  keep entries up to date.


  ### 5. Repository-Level Features

  - Versioned via Git commits, with history of changes to the list.

  - Continuous integration configuration (`.travis.yml`) present for basic
  automated checks on the repository format or structure (based on typical
  awesome-list setups).
