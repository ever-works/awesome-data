### Overview
Our World in Data is an open-access data and research project that compiles, curates, and visualizes global datasets on development, economics, and a wide range of social and environmental indicators. It functions as a centralized, topic-based directory of downloadable data and charts covering global change and major world problems.

### Key Topics & Coverage
- Poverty

- Global education
- CO₂ emissions and greenhouse gas emissions
- Migration
- War & peace
- Life expectancy
- Population growth
- Artificial intelligence
- Trade & globalization
- Medicine & biotechnology
- Lead exposure and regulation (e.g., lead in paint)
- UN Sustainable Development Goals (via SDG tracking)
- Natural disasters

### Scale of the Resource
- **13,914+ charts** across many global indicators
- **123 topic pages** organizing research and data by subject
- **32 data explorers** for interactive exploration of datasets

### Features
- **Topic Pages**
  - Structured pages that bring together data, charts, and written research on specific subjects (e.g., poverty, CO₂ emissions, medicine & biotechnology, trade & globalization).
  - Regularly updated pages to reflect new data and research.

- **Interactive Charts & Maps**
  - Thousands of charts visualizing long-run trends in development, health, environment, economics, and more.
  - Interactive timelines to select years and explore historical data.
  - **Side-by-side map comparison**: ability to display two maps for different years simultaneously (by adding a second year from the timeline).

- **Data Explorers**
  - Specialized interfaces (32 explorers) for working with complex datasets.
  - Let users filter, select indicators, and customize views for comparison.

- **Open Data Access**
  - All charts are backed by downloadable datasets.
  - Data is free to access, reuse, and analyze (open access, open source orientation).

- **Regular Data Updates**
  - Frequent updates to existing charts when new datasets are released (e.g., natural disasters, SDG progress, trade & globalization, medicine & biotech).
  - Large-scale update cycles (e.g., hundreds of charts updated together for SDG tracking).

- **Research Articles & Posts**
  - In-depth articles explaining trends, causes, and implications of the data (e.g., effectiveness of regulations on lead in paint, changes in global trade patterns, impact of medical innovations).
  - Special posts highlighting popular charts and key findings over a given year.

- **Global & Long-Run Focus**
  - Emphasis on global coverage across countries and regions.
  - Historical time series to show long-term changes rather than only recent snapshots.

### Data & Licensing
- Data and visualizations are provided as **free, open-access resources**.
- Emphasis on open-source tooling and transparent data sourcing.

### Pricing
- Access to the website, data, charts, and explorers is **free** (no paid plans mentioned).
