## Overview
Algorithm Visualizations is an Awesome-style curated collection of links to tools, websites, and projects that visually demonstrate algorithms and data structures. It serves as a directory for learners, educators, and developers who want to better understand algorithms through interactive or graphical visualizations.

## Features
- **Curated collection format**
  - Organized as an "Awesome"-style list on GitHub.
  - Focuses specifically on algorithm and data structure visualizations.

- **Algorithm visualization resources**
  - Links to tools that visually explain how algorithms work step-by-step.
  - Includes visualizations for common algorithmic topics (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms, etc. — based on typical scope of such lists, though specific entries are not visible in the provided content).

- **Educational focus**
  - Aimed at helping users understand complex algorithmic concepts through visual and interactive means.
  - Useful for students, teachers, and practitioners learning or teaching data structures and algorithms.

- **Open GitHub-based directory**
  - Hosted on GitHub, allowing community visibility and potential contributions (issues, pull requests) in line with typical Awesome-list practices.

## Use Cases
- Finding visual tools to complement studying algorithms and data structures.
- Discovering interactive demos to use in teaching or presentations.
- Exploring different approaches and tools for algorithm education and explanation.

## Pricing
- Not specified in the provided content. The project appears to be a public GitHub list; access is typically free for such repositories.
