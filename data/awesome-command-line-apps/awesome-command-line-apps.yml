    - **Npm** – Tools around the Node.js/npm ecosystem (e.g., handling `node_modules`).
    - **Boilerplate** – Generators and scaffolding tools.
    - **HTTP Server** – Simple CLI HTTP servers for development and testing.
    - **HTTP Client** – Command-line HTTP clients for testing and interacting with APIs/services.

  - Includes:
    - `readme.md` – main list and documentation.
    - `contributing.md` – guidelines for contributions.
    - Supporting scripts such as `check-for-deprecation.sh` to keep entries current.
  - Public commit history and file structure for transparency and community
  maintenance.


  ### 4. Community & Ecosystem Integration

  - Open to community contributions and improvements via pull requests.


  ## Platforms

  - Cross-platform focus where possible, with tools often relevant to:
    - Linux / Unix
    - macOS
    - Sometimes Windows (depending on the individual CLI tools listed)

  ## Pricing

  - The directory itself is **free and open-source**.

  - Individual tools in the list may have their own licenses or pricing models,
  but this is not centrally managed in the list and must be checked per tool.
