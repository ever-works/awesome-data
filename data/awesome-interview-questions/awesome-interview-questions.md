## Description
Awesome Interview Questions is a curated, open-source directory of links to technical and programming interview question lists. It aggregates many community-maintained question sets, organized by programming language, framework, platform, and topic, to help candidates prepare for technical interviews or create their own interview question lists.

> Note: The project is currently marked as no longer actively supported, but the existing resources remain available.

## Features

### 1. Curated "list of lists"
- Aggregates many separate interview-question lists into one central, organized index.
- Focused on technical and programming interviews.
- Links out to external repositories, articles, and gists rather than hosting all questions directly.

### 2. Topic & Technology Coverage
The repository is structured by major categories, each linking to relevant interview question sets:

- **Programming Languages / Frameworks / Platforms**
  - Android
  - AngularJS
  - Angular
  - BackboneJS
  - C
  - C++

  - Docker
  - Elastic
  - (and additional languages/frameworks/platforms listed in the full README)

- **Database technologies**
  - Collections of interview question lists specific to databases and related tools.

- **Caching technologies**
  - Question lists about caching systems and concepts.

- **Operating Systems (OS)**
  - OS-focused interview questions and concept reviews.

- **Algorithms**
  - Collections of algorithmic interview questions, often used for coding interviews.

- **Blockchain**
  - Question lists covering blockchain fundamentals and implementations.

- **Coding exercises**
  - Links to practice problems and coding challenge-style interview exercises.

- **Comprehensive lists**
  - Broad, multi-topic interview question compilations that span several technologies or roles.

- **Design patterns**
  - Interview questions centered on software design patterns and architectural concepts.

- **Data structures**
  - Question sets on core data structures and their usage in interviews.

- **Networks**
  - Networking concepts and protocol-related interview questions.

- **Security**
  - Lists of questions related to security principles, vulnerabilities, and secure design.

- **Data Science**
  - Interview question lists for data science, machine learning, and related roles.

### 3. Community-driven curation
- Hosted on GitHub, allowing public contributions via pull requests.
- Includes:
  - **`awesome.md`**: Explains what qualifies as an “awesome” list.
  - **`contributing.md`**: Contribution guidelines for adding or updating resources.
  - **`create-list.md`**: Guidance on creating new interview-question lists that can be linked from the main repository.

### 4. Open-source repository structure
- Organized via README-based table of contents for quick navigation.
- Historical commit record with community updates and additions.

## Pricing
- **Free**: The repository and all linked resources that are open/public remain freely accessible on GitHub. There are no paid plans or pricing tiers described.

## Notes
- The maintainers indicate the project is "no longer actively supported," meaning new contributions may not be reviewed regularly, but the existing curated links are still usable as a static resource.
