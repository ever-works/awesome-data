# ICWSM Data Challenge

## Overview
The ICWSM Data Challenge is part of the ICWSM Data Sharing Initiative associated with the AAAI ICWSM conference. It provides large-scale, openly available social media and web datasets used in ICWSM-published research for use in annual research competitions and broader community work.

## Key Details
- **Type:** Research data challenge / dataset sharing service
- **Organizer:** AAAI International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM)
- **Focus:** Social media and web data (e.g., Twitter, blogs, social platforms)
- **Access:** Requires a registration process to obtain datasets
- **Licensing:** Datasets are released as community resources (openly available, subject to registration and any dataset-specific terms)

## Features
- **Dataset Hosting Service**
  - Central hosting of datasets introduced by papers published in ICWSM proceedings.
  - Aims to make research datasets reusable by the wider community.

- **Open Community Resources**
  - All hosted datasets are released as community resources, intended for open research use.
  - Access governed via a registration process (details provided on the site under “obtaining”).

- **Continuously Growing Collection**
  - Initiative active for multiple years (e.g., ICWSM-16 noted as the fifth year).
  - Datasets from multiple conference editions (e.g., 2012, 2015, 2016 and beyond) are or will be made available.

- **Social Media–Focused Datasets**
  - Emphasis on large-scale collections of tweets and other social/web content.
  - Examples of 2015-related datasets (described at a high level by associated papers):
    - Twitter Streaming API vs. Firehose comparison.
    - Dynamics of emergent hashtags (#Bigbirds).
    - Detecting comments on news articles in microblogs.
    - Citation cascades in the blogosphere.
    - User-generated comments for social media object annotation.
    - Multi-indicator tweet geolocation.
    - Meme competition and success (Quickmeme.com).
    - Artist popularity across web and social music services.
    - Diurnal activity patterns from social media.
    - Political orientation inference from Twitter.
    - Political leaning quantification from tweets and retweets.

- **Structured Dataset Descriptions (Example: ICWSM 2012)**
  - Some years provide tabular metadata per dataset, including:
    - Number of files.
    - Number of observations (tweets, accounts, entries, etc.).
    - Number of Twitter users.
    - Network properties where applicable (nodes, edges).
  - Example 2012 datasets include (titles from associated papers):
    - Opinion retrieval in Twitter (tweets labeled as relevant/irrelevant for 50 queries).
    - Target-dependent sentiment expressions for movies and persons.
    - Home location inference from geo-tagged tweets in 100 top cities.
    - Conversation practices and network structure around a TV show (#XFactor Italia).
    - Impact and influence of bots on a social network (anobii.com social data).
    - Managing bad news in social media (Domino’s Pizza crisis tweet collection).
    - Tracking sentiment and topic dynamics from social media (Mozilla add-on reviews; description truncated in source but indicates review data).

- **Conference Integration**
  - Datasets are directly tied to specific ICWSM papers and years, facilitating reproducibility and follow-up work.
  - Supports annual research competitions and challenges run in conjunction with the conference.

## Access and Registration
- Access requires following a **registration process** described on the ICWSM dataset page (section “obtaining”).
- Once registered, users can download available datasets from specific ICWSM years (e.g., 2012, 2015, 2016, etc.).

## Use Cases
- Reproducibility of published ICWSM research.
- Benchmarking new algorithms on established social media datasets.
- Comparative studies across different social media phenomena (hashtags, political communication, sentiment, geolocation, network analysis, etc.).

## Pricing
- The provided content only indicates that datasets are released as **openly available community resources**.
- No pricing or paid plans are mentioned; access appears to be free, subject to registration and any dataset-specific conditions.
