  ## Overview

  Frontend Dev Bookmarks is a manually curated, awesome-style collection of
  resources for frontend web developers. It organizes links to articles, tools,
  patterns, and best practices for modern web development into a structured,
  browsable format.


  ## Features

  - **Manually curated collection**
    - Resources are hand-picked rather than auto-aggregated.
    - Focused specifically on frontend development.

  - **Awesome-style directory**
    - Follows the familiar “awesome list” convention from the broader GitHub community.
    - Presented as a GitHub repository for easy browsing and contribution.

  - **Browseable by category**
    - Content is split into multiple small files and folders by topic:
      - `animation`
      - `appearance`
      - `architecture`
      - `compatibility`
      - `ecosystem`
      - `languages-protocols-browser-apis`
      - `user-interface-components`
      - `workflow`
    - Each folder contains topic-specific links and references.

  - **Single large reference file**
    - Includes `TOTALLY-GIGANTIC-FILE.md`, a consolidated file with all bookmarks in one place for users who prefer a single-page view.

  - **Documentation & meta information**
    - `README.md` explains the list and how to use it.
    - `about.md` provides background on the project.
    - `contributing.md` outlines how others can propose additions or changes.

  ## Content Types

  - Articles and guides on frontend techniques and patterns.

  - Tools and libraries relevant to frontend work.

  - Best practices for architecture, compatibility, UI components, and workflow.

  - References for web languages, protocols, and browser APIs.
