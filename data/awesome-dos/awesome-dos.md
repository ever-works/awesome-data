## Overview

Awesome DOS is a curated "awesome list" focused on DOS, the family of x86-based operating systems (including IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS) popular in the 1980s and early 1990s. It targets people interested in retro-programming and learning about DOS, collecting links to tools, educational material, and historical resources.

The list is intended as a starting point for:
- Developing DOS applications and games
- Learning DOS programming and internals
- Exploring original and open source DOS software and code

## Main Sections

- Development tools
- Tutorials and programming resources
- Books
- Videos
- Source code
  - Open source DOS operating systems
  - Open source DOS libraries
  - Open source DOS games
- Drivers and emulators

## Features

### 1. Development Tools

Curated compilers, IDEs, debuggers, and toolchains for DOS development, including:

- **bcc – Bruce's C Compiler**  
  Simple C compiler that produces 8086 assembler for tiny/small memory models.

- **DJGPP**  
  32-bit C/C++ development environment for Intel 80386-based systems, historically used for games such as Quake.

- **GCC IA-16 toolchain**  
  GCC-based toolchain for 16-bit (8086–80286, IA-16) DOS applications, maintained by TK Chia.

- **Insight**  
  Small debugger for real-mode DOS programs, with a Borland Turbo-style UI. Includes:
  - i80486 disassembler
  - i8086 assembler

- **Open Watcom**  
  Former commercial C/C++ development environment for 16- and 32-bit DOS and Windows. Notes:
  - Current official version: 1.9
  - Used historically for titles like Doom I–II, Warcraft I–II, Duke Nukem 3D, Full Throttle, Dark Forces, Retro City Rampage
  - Documentation is highlighted as valuable for working with both v1.9 and the V2 fork
  - Additional reference via an Arch Wiki page

- **Open Watcom V2**  
  Actively maintained GitHub fork of Open Watcom:
  - Ported to 64-bit Windows and Linux

- **Turbo C 2.01**  
  C IDE and compiler from Borland, first released in 1987.

- **Turbo C++ 1.01**  
  C++ IDE and compiler from Borland, released in 1991.

- **Turbo C++ 3.0**  
  C++ IDE and compiler from Borland, released in 1992.
  - Includes a link to an online version runnable in the browser.

- **DIV Games Studio 2**  
  IDE for developing DOS games with support for:
  - 2D
  - Mode 7
  - 3D 
  Originally released in 1998.
  - Includes an online/browser-based version.

- **T3X**  
  A small, portable programming language by Nils M. Holm. Characteristics:
  - Procedural
  - Block-structured
  - Recursive
  - Almost typeless
  - To some degree object-oriented

- **SmallerC**  
  A small C compiler (entry is truncated in provided content, but listed as part of the toolset).

### 2. Learning & Reference Content

The list (from its table of contents and description) also aggregates:

- **Tutorials and programming resources**  
  Guides and references for DOS development and understanding DOS internals.

- **Books**  
  Links to both free and paid books about DOS, its programming model, and related technologies.

- **Videos**  
  Curated video content for learning DOS programming and history.

### 3. Source Code Collections

The list points to open source codebases relevant to DOS:

- **Open source DOS operating systems**  
  Source code for DOS-compatible or DOS-like systems.

- **Open source DOS libraries**  
  Libraries intended for DOS software development.

- **Open source DOS games**  
  Game source code targeting DOS.

### 4. Drivers and Emulators

Curated links to:

- **Drivers** for DOS environments
- **Emulators** to run DOS software on modern systems

These support development, testing, and exploration of DOS software without original hardware.

## Pricing

- This is a free, open GitHub-based curated list. No pricing or paid plans are associated with the list itself (some linked resources may be paid, as noted in their own documentation).
