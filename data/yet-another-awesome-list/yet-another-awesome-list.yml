  ## Overview

  Yet Another Awesome List (yaal) is a meta awesome list that automatically
  aggregates and generates curated collections of other awesome lists. It
  focuses on organizing topic-specific directories (for example, AI and large
  language models) into a single, browsable catalog so users can discover and
  navigate multiple awesome lists from one place.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-directory of awesome lists**  
    - Collects and organizes other awesome lists into a unified index.  
    - Targets topic-focused directories, including AI and large language models.

  - **Automated aggregation**  
    - Uses scripts and configuration in the repository (`lib`, `scripts`, and related files) to automatically gather and update lists.  
    - Generates curated collections rather than requiring entirely manual maintenance.

  - **Generated browsable catalog**  
    - Publishes an interface at `0xwelt.github.io/yaal` for browsing aggregated awesome lists.  
    - Structures content as topic-specific sections to simplify discovery.

  - **Project documentation**  
    - `README.md` provides general project information.  
    - `USAGE.md` contains usage instructions for running or interacting with the project.  
    - Additional docs under `docs/` (e.g., more detailed configuration or architecture notes).

  - **Configurable / extensible codebase**  
    - Next.js configuration (`next.config.mjs`) for the web front end.  
    - ESLint and Prettier configuration for consistent development settings.  
    - GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`) for automated tasks (such as building or deployment).  
    - Husky hooks (`.husky/`) for enforcing checks during development.

  - **AI-related tooling notes**  
    - `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` suggest documentation for AI/agent usage or guidance related to maintaining or generating the list with AI tooling.
