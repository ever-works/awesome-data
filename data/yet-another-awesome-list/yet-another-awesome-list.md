## Overview
Yet Another Awesome List (yaal) is a meta awesome list that automatically aggregates and generates curated collections of other awesome lists. It focuses on organizing topic-specific directories (for example, AI and large language models) into a single, browsable catalog so users can discover and navigate multiple awesome lists from one place.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of awesome lists**  
  - Collects and organizes other awesome lists into a unified index.  
  - Targets topic-focused directories, including AI and large language models.

- **Automated aggregation**  
  - Uses scripts and configuration in the repository (`lib`, `scripts`, and related files) to automatically gather and update lists.  
  - Generates curated collections rather than requiring entirely manual maintenance.

- **Generated browsable catalog**  
  - Publishes an interface at `0xwelt.github.io/yaal` for browsing aggregated awesome lists.  
  - Structures content as topic-specific sections to simplify discovery.

- **Project documentation**  
  - `README.md` provides general project information.  
  - `USAGE.md` contains usage instructions for running or interacting with the project.  
  - Additional docs under `docs/` (e.g., more detailed configuration or architecture notes).

- **Configurable / extensible codebase**  
  - Next.js configuration (`next.config.mjs`) for the web front end.  
  - ESLint and Prettier configuration for consistent development settings.  
  - GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`) for automated tasks (such as building or deployment).  
  - Husky hooks (`.husky/`) for enforcing checks during development.

- **AI-related tooling notes**  
  - `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` suggest documentation for AI/agent usage or guidance related to maintaining or generating the list with AI tooling.
