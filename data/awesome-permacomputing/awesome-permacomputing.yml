  # Awesome Permacomputing


  **URL:** https://github.com/idematos/awesome-permacomputing#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** sustainability, computing, awesome-lists


  ## Overview

  Awesome Permacomputing is a curated “awesome list” of resources, projects, and
  communities related to permacomputing—a concept and community of practice
  focused on resilient and regenerative computing inspired by permaculture. It
  organizes links to tools, experiments, and references that explore sustainable
  approaches to computer and network technology.


  ## Features


  ### Scope and Focus

  - Curates materials centered on **resilience** and **regenerativity** in
  computing.

  - Inspired by **permaculture principles** applied to computer and network
  technology.

  - Includes both the **conceptual** side (ideas, theory, critique) and
  **practical** side (software, hardware, experiments, communities).


  ### Organized Contents

  The repository is structured into major sections for easier discovery:


  #### 1. Resources

  - **Websites** – External sites and hubs focused on permacomputing and related
  sustainable tech topics.

  - **Articles** – Essays, blog posts, and written reflections on permacomputing
  concepts and practices.

  - **Books**
    - *Fiction* – Stories or speculative fiction touching on permacomputing-adjacent themes (e.g., low-tech, post-growth, degrowth computing futures).
    - *Non-fiction* – Theoretical, technical, or critical works on sustainability, infrastructure, and computing.
  - **Visual**
    - *Comics* – Visual narratives and comics that convey ideas related to permacomputing and resilient technology.
  - **Audiovisual**
    - *Fiction* – Films or fictional media exploring themes relevant to permacomputing.
    - *Documentaries* – Non-fiction video content on sustainable computing, infrastructure, or related movements.
    - *Talks* – Recorded talks, presentations, and lectures about permacomputing and regenerative tech.

  #### 2. Projects

  - **Software**
    - *Operating Systems* – OS projects that emphasize low-resource, long-lived, or repairable computing.
    - *Code Editors* – Editors or IDEs designed with efficiency or minimalism in mind.
    - *Tools* – Utilities and software tools that support sustainable computing practices.
    - *Protocols* – Network or communication protocols optimized for low bandwidth, resilience, or longevity.
    - *Browsers* – Web browsers focusing on low resource usage or alternative interaction models.
    - *Search Engines* – Search tools or engines aligned with sustainability or small-web principles.
    - *Social* – Social platforms or tools exploring low-energy or small-scale networked interaction.
  - **Hardware**
    - *Devices* – Physical devices oriented toward durability, repairability, or low-power usage.
    - *Repairing* – Projects and resources that encourage repair, maintenance, and extending device lifespans.
    - *Repurposing* – Initiatives that reuse or reconfigure existing hardware for new, sustainable purposes.
  - **Experimental**
    - Experimental projects that test new ideas in low-tech, off-grid, regenerative, or resilient computing.

  #### 3. Communities

  - **Collectives**
    - *Computing* – Groups, labs, or collectives focused on permacomputing and sustainable tech.
    - *Art* – Artistic groups or initiatives exploring permacomputing themes through creative practice.
  - **Forums** – Discussion spaces and community forums where permacomputing
  practitioners and enthusiasts gather.
