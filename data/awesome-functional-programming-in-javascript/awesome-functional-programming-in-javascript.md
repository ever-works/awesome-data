## Overview

Awesome Functional Programming in JavaScript is a curated GitHub directory of libraries, tools, and learning resources for doing functional programming (FP) in JavaScript. It helps developers use JavaScript’s functional features more effectively by collecting FP-focused code, articles, books, and examples in one place.

## Features

### Core Focus
- Curated list specifically dedicated to **functional programming in JavaScript**.
- Emphasis on **side-effect free functions**, **immutable data**, and **expression-based** code.
- Aimed at using JavaScript’s multi-paradigm capabilities in a **functional style**.

### Library Directory
- Collection of **functional programming libraries** for JavaScript.
- Includes common FP constructs such as:
  - `pipe()`
  - `Maybe`
  - `Result`
- Tagging system for entries, allowing annotations like:
  - `-TS` (likely indicating presence/absence of TypeScript typings)
  - `-CT` (another filter tag mentioned in the list)
- Tags are designed to help filter libraries for specific needs (e.g., TypeScript users).

### Data Structures
- Section dedicated to **functional data structures** for writing performant FP-style code.
- Focus on choosing the right structure to enable efficient and idiomatic functional patterns.

### Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)
- Section covering **algebraic data types** and related concepts, including common variants:
  - `undefined`
  - `null`
  - `Either`
  - `Maybe`
  - `Result`
  - `Ok`
  - `Err`
- Encourages using mathematically grounded abstractions instead of ad-hoc designs.

### Lenses
- Section for **lenses** and related optics tools for immutable data manipulation.

### Functional Languages that Compile to JavaScript
- Directory of **functional-first languages** and projects that **compile to JavaScript**.
- Useful for exploring FP beyond plain JS while still targeting the JS ecosystem.

### Programming Tools
- Section for **developer tools** that support or enhance functional programming workflows in JavaScript.

### Learning Resources

#### Books
- Curated list of **books** on functional programming concepts and their application in JavaScript.

#### Articles
- Collection of **articles** covering FP patterns and abstractions in JS.
- Mentions topics/constructs such as:
  - `Maybe`
  - `Either`
  - `Validation`

#### Videos
- Section for **video resources** (talks, lectures, tutorials) on FP in JavaScript.

#### Examples and Exercises
- Practical section with **examples and exercises** demonstrating FP techniques such as:
  - `map`
  - `filter`
  - `concatAll`
  - `reduce`
  - `zip`

### Community & Meta
- **Contribution guidelines** for adding new libraries and resources.
- **Code of conduct** file in the repository to define community expectations.
- **Related lists** section pointing to other curated collections in the broader FP ecosystem.
- **Talk** section for references to conferences or presentations related to FP in JS.
