  ## Overview

  Awesome AGI & CoCoSci is a curated "awesome" list focused on Artificial
  General Intelligence (AGI) and Computational Cognitive Sciences (CoCoSci). It
  collects learning resources, research papers, books, and related materials for
  understanding and advancing human-level machine intelligence, especially from
  cognitively inspired and interdisciplinary perspectives.


  ## Features

  - **Curated AGI & CoCoSci directory**
    - Centralized collection of resources on the intersection of AGI and computational cognitive science.
    - Emphasis on high-level machine intelligence inspired by human learning and thinking.

  - **Interdisciplinary scope**
    - Core focus on artificial intelligence and computational cognitive sciences.
    - Includes related areas such as:
      - Probability and statistics
      - Formal logic
      - Cognitive and developmental psychology
      - Computational philosophy
      - Cognitive neuroscience
      - Computational sociology

  - **All-in-one resource collection**
    - Covers a range from introductory to advanced material.
    - Includes:
      - Basic courses and tutorials
