  **Tags:** robotics, education, awesome-lists


  ## Overview

  Awesome FIRST Robotics Competition (Awesome FRC) is a curated GitHub directory
  of packages, tools, and learning resources for teams participating in the
  FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), a global high school robotics challenge. It
  aggregates community-maintained links to software, libraries, guides, and
  other materials relevant to FRC robot design, programming, and team
  operations.


  ## Features

  - **Curated resource list for FRC**  
    - Focused specifically on the FIRST Robotics Competition context.  
    - Includes both tools and educational materials useful during the build and competition seasons.

  - **Organized by topic** (as indicated in the repository contents):  
    - **General** – Broad FRC-related tools and references that don’t fit a narrow category.  
    - **Suppliers** – Links to vendors and suppliers relevant to FRC parts and components.  
    - **Programming** – Software resources, libraries, and tools for coding FRC robots.  
    - **Vision** – Resources related to computer vision and vision processing for FRC robots.  
    - **Scouting** – Tools and packages to support match scouting and data collection.  
    - **Driving** – Resources related to robot driving, control, or driver-station tooling (includes at least one mention of `nw.js`).  
    - **Community** – Links to FRC-related communities and communication channels.  
    - **Repositories** – Example and reference code repositories grouped by language:
      - Java/Kotlin  
      - C++  
      - C#  
      - Python  
      - CSS  
      - Ruby  
      - JavaScript
    - **Videos** – Video-based learning and reference material.  
    - **Miscellaneous** – Additional useful FRC-related resources that don’t fit other sections.

  - **Open-source GitHub repository**  
    - Publicly accessible via GitHub.  
    - Includes a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file describing how contributors can suggest or add entries.  
    - Licensed via an included `LICENSE` file, allowing reuse under the stated open-source terms.

  - **Structured for collaboration**  
    - Maintained as an Awesome List (conforms to the Awesome List style and badge).  
    - Contributions from multiple community members (contributors listed in GitHub).  
    - Organized README structure for easy navigation of topics.

  ## Target Audience

  - FRC student team members (programmers, builders, drivers, scouts).  

  - Mentors and coaches looking for teaching and reference material.  

  - Developers and community members who want a central index of FRC-compatible
  tools and libraries.


  ## Pricing

  - **Free** – The Awesome FRC list and its contents (the curated index itself)
  are available at no cost as a public GitHub repository. Any external tools or
  services linked from the list may have their own pricing, but that is outside
  the scope of this directory.


  ## License

  - The repository includes a `LICENSE` file specifying the terms under which
  the list can be used and shared (see the GitHub repository for exact license
  text).


  ## Contributing

  - Community contributions are welcomed through the GitHub repository.  

  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` provides guidelines for adding or modifying entries in the
  list.
