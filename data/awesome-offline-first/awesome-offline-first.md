## Key Sections

### W3C Specifications
Curated links to foundational web standards relevant to offline-first architecture:

- **Offline Web Applications**  
  - Covers HTML5 features for offline behavior:  
    - SQL databases
    - Offline application caching APIs
    - Online/offline events and status
    - `localStorage` API
  - Includes brief tutorials on using these features to build offline-capable web apps.

- **Service Workers**  
  - Defines persistent background processing in the browser.
  - Provides hooks for:
    - Bootstrapping web apps while offline
    - Intercepting network requests
    - Managing caches for offline usage.

- **IndexedDB**  
  - Defines a low-level API for structured data storage in the browser.
  - Core concepts:
    - Database of records with keys and values
    - Support for hierarchical objects
    - Indexes for efficient lookup
    - Direct API access for key-based or index-based queries
    - Implementation typically using persistent B-tree data structures
    - A query language can be layered on top of the API.

### Newsletter

- **The Offline First Reader**  
  - Monthly newsletter focused on offline-first topics.  
  - Covers:
    - Theory and concepts of offline-first design
    - Technology and implementation practices
    - User experience patterns for offline and low-connectivity scenarios

### Posts (Articles & Guides)

A curated set of articles on patterns, UX, and technical implementation of offline-first apps, including:
