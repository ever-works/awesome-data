  # Awesome Public Datasets – Finance / Google Trends (Finance)

  **Category:** Themed Directories  
  **Tags:** datasets, finance, analytics  
  **Source:** [Google Trends – Finance-related search interest](http://www.google.com/trends?q=google&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0)  
  **Collection:** awesomedata / Awesome Public Datasets

  ## Overview
  This entry in the Awesome Public Datasets catalog links to **Google Trends** as a public data source for analyzing **finance-related search interest and trends**. It provides access to Google’s aggregated, anonymized search volume indices, which can be used to study public interest over time in financial topics, instruments, and markets.

  ## Features
  - **Public search-trend data**
    - Access to aggregated Google search interest over time.
    - Relative search volume indices rather than raw counts.
    - Global and regional trend data (geo filters such as countries/regions where available in Google Trends).

  - **Finance-focused use cases**
    - Analyze interest in financial assets (e.g., stocks, indices, commodities, cryptocurrencies) via their names or tickers (where recognized as search terms).
    - Track public attention around macroeconomic terms (e.g., “inflation”, “interest rates”, “recession”).
    - Study seasonality and spikes in finance-related queries (e.g., around earnings seasons, policy announcements, or crises).

  - **Time-based analysis**
    - Historical trend visualizations across customizable date ranges (e.g., entire history, last 5 years, custom intervals), subject to what Google Trends supports.
    - Identification of peaks and troughs in search interest over time.

  - **Geographic and topical segmentation**
    - Filter and compare search interest across different geographies (worldwide vs. specific regions or countries, as supported by Google Trends).
    - Explore related queries and topics surfaced by Google Trends to expand or refine financial research terms.

  - **Comparative analytics**
    - Compare multiple search terms side-by-side (e.g., compare interest in different stocks, asset classes, or economic topics).
    - Use relative indexing to benchmark terms against each other.

  - **Visualization and exploration tools** *(inherent to Google Trends interface)*
    - Built-in charts for visualizing search interest over time.
    - Regional heatmaps indicating where certain financial topics are most searched.
    - Interface sections that cover basics, understanding the data, and more advanced usage (as indicated by training imagery such as “data”, “basics”, “understanding”, “advanced”).

  - **Integration into research workflows**
    - Suitable as a complementary indicator in quantitative or qualitative financial research.
    - Can be used to generate hypotheses about market sentiment or public awareness around financial events.

  ## Pricing
  - Not specified in the provided content. Google Trends is typically available as a **free-to-use** web tool, though the dataset is accessed via the Google Trends interface rather than as a bulk-download product in this listing.
