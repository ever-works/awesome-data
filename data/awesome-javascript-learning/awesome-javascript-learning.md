## Overview

Awesome JavaScript Learning is a curated GitHub directory of high-quality resources focused on learning the JavaScript programming language itself. It collects tutorials, guides, and reference material aimed at helping learners deepen their understanding of core JavaScript concepts rather than frameworks, tooling, or browser APIs.

## Features

- **Curated “awesome list” format**  
  A GitHub-hosted list that follows the Awesome List conventions for structure and quality.

- **Focus on the JavaScript language**  
  Concentrates on JavaScript fundamentals and language features, explicitly excluding or minimizing content about:
  - Browser or platform APIs
  - Tooling and build systems
  - Frameworks and libraries

- **Learning resources directory**  
  Aggregates a variety of learning materials, such as:
  - Articles and blog posts
  - Tutorials and guides
  - Reference documentation

- **JavaScript references section**  
  Dedicated section for reference-style resources to look up language syntax and behavior.

- **Articles & Tutorials section**  
  Organized articles and tutorials, including an *Overall Topics* area for broad JavaScript subject coverage.

- **External high‑quality links**  
  Integrates well-known, reputable resources such as MDN Web Docs and its JavaScript guides.

- **Open contribution model**  
  Accepts community contributions via GitHub pull requests, guided by documented contribution guidelines.

- **Community standards**  
  Includes a Code of Conduct to define expected behavior for contributors and maintainers.

- **Versioned and maintained repository**  
  Structured as a standard Git repository (with configuration files like `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `package.json`) to support maintenance, consistency, and potential tooling.

## Pricing

- **Free**: The directory and all listed GitHub content are freely accessible. Individual linked resources may have their own terms, but the list itself is open and free to use.
