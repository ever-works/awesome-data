  # NeuroMorpho.Org


  **Category:** Datasets  

  **Website:** http://neuromorpho.org/  

  **Type:** Open-access neuroscience data repository


  ## Overview

  NeuroMorpho.Org is a centrally curated, open-access repository of digitally
  reconstructed neurons and glia derived from peer-reviewed publications. It
  aggregates and standardizes morphological reconstructions contributed by over
  1000 laboratories worldwide, making them publicly available for reuse in
  neuroscience research.


  ## Features

  - **Digitally reconstructed cells**
    - 3D reconstructions of neurons
    - 3D reconstructions of glial cells
  - **Curated, literature-linked data**
    - All reconstructions are associated with peer-reviewed publications
    - Central curation to ensure consistency and quality
  - **Largest public collection**
    - Extensive inventory of 3D neuronal morphologies
    - Dense coverage of available reconstruction data from the literature
  - **Rich metadata**
    - Morphological reconstructions accompanied by associated metadata (e.g., experimental and anatomical context as provided in source publications)
  - **Global contributions**
    - Data submissions from more than 1000 laboratories worldwide
    - Continuously updated as new reconstructions are collected, published, and shared
  - **Open access and reuse**
    - Publicly accessible dataset repository
    - Designed to support data sharing and enable further analysis, modeling, and re-analysis of existing morphological data
  - **Community engagement**
    - Encourages both new and existing contributors to share data
    - Online survey for users and contributors to influence future development of the resource

  ## Use Cases

  - Computational modeling of neuronal and glial morphology

  - Quantitative morphometric analyses

  - Comparative studies across brain regions, species, or cell types (as
  available in the underlying data)

  - Re-analysis of published datasets for new hypotheses

  - Method development and benchmarking in neuroinformatics and image-based
  reconstruction


  ## Pricing

  - Access to NeuroMorpho.Org is **open and publicly available**.  
    (No paid pricing plans are indicated in the provided content.)
