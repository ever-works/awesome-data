  ## Overview

  meta-awesome: Error Handling is a curated meta-list that aggregates multiple
  “awesome” lists and resources focused on error handling in software
  development. It serves as a central index to discover concepts, patterns, and
  tools related to designing and implementing robust error handling across
  different languages, frameworks, and ecosystems.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-aggregation of awesome lists**
    - Collects links to multiple independent “awesome error handling”–style lists.
    - Acts as an overview or map of the error-handling resource landscape.

  - **Focus on error handling concepts**
    - Highlights resources explaining foundational error handling concepts.
    - Covers topics like exceptions vs. error values, retries, fallbacks, and fault tolerance at a conceptual level (where provided by the linked lists).

  - **Patterns and best practices**
    - Indexes lists that discuss common error handling patterns.
    - Surfaces guidance on best practices for designing error propagation and reporting in applications and services.

  - **Tooling and libraries**
    - Points to awesome lists that catalog tools and libraries for error handling (e.g., logging, monitoring, tracing, exception handling utilities, failure injection tools), depending on what each linked list covers.

  - **Language- and framework-related coverage**
    - Provides a jumping-off point to language- or framework-specific error handling resources, via the underlying awesome lists (if they organize content this way).

  - **Developer-focused directory**
    - Aimed at developers who want to improve reliability, observability, and resilience of their systems.
    - Organized as a simple markdown document for easy browsing and contribution on GitHub.

  ## Intended Use

  - Quickly discover specialized awesome lists dedicated to error handling.

  - Use as a starting index for studying error handling theory, implementation
  patterns, and tooling.

  - Reference when evaluating or comparing error handling approaches across
  ecosystems.


  ## Pricing

  - Accessed as an open GitHub repository/document.  

  - No pricing or paid plans are associated with this meta-list itself (subject
  to GitHub’s standard free access to public repositories).
