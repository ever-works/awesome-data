  ## Overview

  Awesome iOS UI is a curated, open-source directory of iOS UI and UX libraries.
  It aggregates links to user interface components, animation libraries, and
  interaction patterns for iOS apps, with metadata such as language and license.


  ## Features

  - **Curated collection of iOS UI/UX libraries**
    - Focused specifically on visual and interaction components for iOS.
    - Includes both Objective-C and Swift projects.

  - **Categorized index**
    - Libraries are grouped into topical sections; one visible example is:
      - **Animations and Transitions** – libraries for animated transitions and motion effects.

  - **Library metadata**
    - Each listed repository includes:
      - Repository link.
      - Implementation language (e.g., Objective-C, Swift).
      - License information (e.g., MIT, Apache v2, Unknown when not specified).

  - **Example entries (Animations and Transitions)**
    - **AnimatedTransitionGallery** (Obj-C, license unknown) – sample animated transition gallery.
    - **RZTransitions** (Obj-C, MIT) – custom view controller transitions.
    - **DCAnimationKit** (Obj-C, Apache v2) – animation toolkit.
    - **PMTween** (Obj-C, MIT) – tweening/animation engine.
    - **SAHistoryNavigationViewController** (Swift, MIT) – navigation controller with history-style transitions.
    - **WobbleView** (Swift, MIT) – wobble-style view animations.
    - **CBZSplashView** (Obj-C, MIT) – animated splash screen view.

  - **Visual previews**
    - Animated GIFs and images embedded for some libraries (e.g., AnimatedTransitionGallery) to showcase behavior.

  - **Community contributions**
    - Open contribution model via a companion tool (`awesome-creator`) where developers can submit metadata for new UI/UX libraries.
