  ## Overview

  Awesome D3 is a curated directory of D3.js libraries, plugins, and utilities
  focused on data visualization. It helps developers discover third‑party tools
  that extend or complement the D3.js ecosystem.


  ## Features

  - **Curated D3 ecosystem list**
    - Focuses specifically on D3.js‑related libraries, plugins, and utilities.
    - Maintained as part of the broader "Awesome" list ecosystem.

  - **Categorized entries**
    - **Charts** – third‑party charting libraries built on top of D3.js.
    - **Maps** – third‑party mapping and geospatial visualization tools using D3.js.
    - **Utils** – utilities, helpers, and supporting tools that work with D3.js.
    - **Miscellaneous** – additional D3‑related projects that don’t fit standard categories.
    - **Server side** – tools and libraries for using D3.js or related workflows on the server.
    - **Bl.ocks.org Profiles** – references to notable D3 authors and their example collections.

  - **Discovery tooling**
    - Integrates with an interactive **D3 Discovery** tool (https://d3-discovery.net/) to explore entries visually.

  - **Separation from tutorials/resources**
    - Intentionally excludes tutorials and conceptual articles, instead pointing users to an external, dedicated list of D3 readings and tutorials.

  - **Community-driven curation**
    - Maintained by named curators from webkid.io.
    - Contribution guidelines available via `CONTRIBUTING.md` for community submissions and updates.

  - **Open source repository**
    - Hosted on GitHub with visible history, contributors, and license.
    - Distributed under an open-source license (`LICENSE` file in repo).
