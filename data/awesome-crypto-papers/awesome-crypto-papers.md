## Description
Awesome Crypto Papers is a curated, educational list of cryptography papers, articles, tutorials, and how‑tos, focused on helping non‑cryptographers who use cryptography in higher‑level systems. It emphasizes practical understanding of how cryptography works, how it fails, and how it is attacked.

## Features
- **Curated reading list** of cryptography resources (papers, articles, tutorials, how‑tos).
- **Educational focus for non‑cryptographers**, especially:
  - Engineers implementing database encryption.
  - Developers working on secure sharing mechanisms.
  - Teams building end‑to‑end encryption schemes.
- **Multiple knowledge levels** covered, from introductory to more advanced topics.
- **Practical orientation** toward real‑world use of cryptography in security systems rather than purely academic study.
- **Not a historical or “greatest hits” list**; items are selected for “must‑have” educational value.
- **Not targeted at academics or formal cryptography students**; assumes readers are practitioners needing to apply crypto correctly.
- **Gradually expanded and maintained** as new high‑value materials are found.
- **Open contribution model** via GitHub pull requests.
- Part of the broader **Awesome Lists** ecosystem (follows the Awesome list format and standards).

## Pricing
- Free access (open GitHub repository).
