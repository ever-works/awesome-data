  # Awesome Scala Native


  **Website:** <https://github.com/tindzk/awesome-scala-native#readme>


  ## Overview

  Awesome Scala Native is a curated “awesome list” directory focused on Scala
  Native, an optimizing ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler for the Scala programming
  language based on LLVM. The list compiles resources, libraries, and tools that
  help developers build native Scala applications without relying on the JVM.


  ## Key Concepts

  - **Scala Native**: An optimising AOT compiler for Scala that produces native
  binaries.

  - **LLVM-based**: Emits LLVM intermediate representation instead of JVM
  bytecode, then uses LLVM toolchain to create native executables and libraries.

  - **Standalone executables**: Generated programs run without a JVM, typically
  with shorter startup times and lower memory usage.

  - **Deployment targets**: Suitable for environments where a JVM is undesirable
  or unavailable, such as command-line tools or embedded devices.


  ## Features

  - **Curated directory of Scala Native ecosystem**:
    - Tutorials and examples for learning Scala Native.
    - Build tools integrations and related utilities.
    - Functional programming libraries targeting Scala Native.
    - Unit testing libraries and frameworks compatible with Scala Native.
    - Bindings to native libraries via Scala Native.
    - File formats and parsers supporting Scala Native projects.
    - Database-related libraries usable from Scala Native.
    - Web development libraries and tools working with Scala Native.
    - Concurrency utilities adapted to native runtimes.
    - Logging libraries compatible with Scala Native.
    - Console and CLI-related utilities.
    - Robotics-related libraries or bindings.
    - Example programs and applications built with Scala Native.
    - Infrastructure-related tools (e.g., CI, packaging, deployment) for Scala Native projects.

  - **Ecosystem-oriented**:
    - Focuses on collecting community-maintained projects and resources.
    - Organised by category for easier discovery.

  - **Contribution guidelines**:
    - Includes a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for users to propose additions or changes to the list.
