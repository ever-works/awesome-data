  # CommonCrawl Web Data


  **URL:** http://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/


  ## Overview

  CommonCrawl Web Data is a public, petabyte-scale repository of web crawl data
  collected over many years. It provides raw web page content and associated
  metadata from regular crawls of the public web, enabling large-scale
  analytics, research, and machine learning applications.


  ## Features

  - **Long-term crawl history**  
    - Multiple named crawl releases from 2015 through 2025 (e.g., `CC-MAIN-2025-51`, `CC-MAIN-2025-47`, …, `CC-MAIN-2015-32`).  
    - Enables longitudinal and time-based analyses of web content.

  - **Petabyte-scale web corpus**  
    - Large-scale collection of raw web pages and metadata.  
    - Suitable for big data processing, web mining, and training large models.

  - **Public AWS S3 hosting**  
    - Data stored in Amazon S3 in region **`us-east-1`** (access from this region is mandatory for S3-based access).  
    - Accessible via `s3://commoncrawl/...` paths.  
    - Many AWS services (e.g., EMR) can directly consume the S3 paths, often with wildcard support.

  - **S3 access recommendations**  
    - Access from within `us-east-1` to avoid inter-region data transfer charges and improve latency.  
    - Caution about using Elastic IPs or load balancers, which may incur additional routed traffic costs.  
    - On non-EMR Hadoop clusters, use the **S3A protocol** (e.g., `s3a://commoncrawl/...`) for improved compatibility and performance.

  - **HTTP/HTTPS access without AWS account**  
    - Data can be downloaded directly over HTTPS via URLs of the form:  
      `https://data.commoncrawl.org/[path_to_file]`  
    - Compatible with standard HTTP download tools such as **cURL** and **wget**.  
    - No AWS account required for HTTP-based access.

  - **AWS CLI integration**  
    - Data can be accessed and managed using the **AWS Command Line Interface**, pointing to the Common Crawl S3 bucket.  
    - Works with AWS services that support S3 as an input data source.

  ## Access Methods

  - **From AWS (recommended for large-scale processing)**  
    - Region: `us-east-1`  
    - S3 URL scheme: `s3://commoncrawl/path_to_file`  
    - Hadoop (non-EMR): use `s3a://commoncrawl/path_to_file`.

  - **From local machines or external clusters**  
    - HTTPS URL scheme: `https://data.commoncrawl.org/path_to_file`  
    - Use tools like `curl` or `wget` to download files.  
    - No AWS account needed for this method.

  ## Pricing

  - The content provided does not specify explicit pricing plans.  

  - Noted cost considerations relate to **AWS infrastructure charges** when
  accessing via S3 (e.g., inter-region data transfer, Elastic IP or load
  balancer traffic), which are billed by AWS, not by Common Crawl itself.
