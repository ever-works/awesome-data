  # High-Resolution Contact Networks from Wearable Sensors


  **Category:** Datasets  

  **Source:** [SocioPatterns –
  Datasets](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/)  

  **Brand:** awesomedata


  ## Overview

  A collection of high-resolution temporal contact network datasets obtained
  through the SocioPatterns sensing platform. The datasets capture close-range
  proximity and interaction patterns between individuals (humans and animals)
  using wearable sensors and, in some cases, complementary observational data.


  ## Features

  - **High-resolution temporal contact networks**
    - Time-resolved records of face-to-face or close-proximity interactions.
    - Data suitable for dynamic network analysis and temporal graph modeling.

  - **Wearable proximity sensors**
    - Contacts measured via the SocioPatterns sensing platform.
    - Objective, sensor-based detection of spatial proximity.

  - **Multiple social settings and populations**
    - **Human social contacts** (e.g., rural village in Malawi):
      - 86 individuals living in a village in rural Malawi.
      - Observational contact data collected and analyzed for social contact pattern characterization.
      - Dataset file example: `tnet_malawi_pilot.csv` (time-resolved network data).
    - **Animal social interactions** (e.g., Guinea baboons):
      - Group of 20 Guinea baboons in an enclosure at a Primate Center in France.
      - Data collected between June 13, 2019 and July 10, 2019.
      - Includes both wearable sensor data and detailed observational records.

  - **Detailed observational annotations (Baboons’ interactions dataset)**
    - `OBS_data.txt` file containing behavioral events with 8 columns:
      - **DateTime** – Timestamp of the event (start time for state events).
      - **Actor** – Name/ID of the individual performing the behavior.
      - **Recipient** – Name/ID of the individual receiving the behavior.
      - **Behavior** – Labeled behavior type. Registered behaviors include:
        - Resting, Grooming, Presenting, Playing with, Grunting-Lipsmacking,
          Supplanting, Threatening, Submission, Touching, Avoiding, Attacking,
          Carrying, Embracing, Mounting, Copulating, Chasing.
        - Additional categories: Invisible, Other.
      - **Category** – Behavior classification:
        - Affiliative, Agonistic, Other.
      - **Duration** – Duration of the observed behavior (POINT events have no duration).
      - **Localisation** – Zone of the enclosure where the behavior occurs.
      - **Point** – Indicator for point vs. state events (as described in the dataset docs).

  - **Published and documented datasets**
    - Datasets are linked to peer-reviewed publications detailing data collection and analysis methodologies (e.g., EPJ Data Science, Proc. R. Soc. A).
    - Each dataset page provides download links (e.g., `*.csv.gz`, text files) and study context.

  - **Use cases**
    - Modeling and simulation of infectious disease transmission via contact networks.
    - Analysis of human social mixing patterns in real-world environments.
    - Study of animal social structure and comparison of sensor-based vs. direct observation methods.
    - Methodological research in temporal networks and behavioral ecology.

  ## Data Access

  - Data are available through the SocioPatterns website under the **DATA /
  Datasets** section:  
    [http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/)
  - Individual dataset pages provide direct links to data files (e.g.,
  `tnet_malawi_pilot.csv.gz`, `OBS_data.txt`) and detailed documentation.


  ## Pricing

  - No pricing information is provided in the source content. Access conditions
  (e.g., open data, licensing) should be checked on each dataset’s page on the
  SocioPatterns website.
