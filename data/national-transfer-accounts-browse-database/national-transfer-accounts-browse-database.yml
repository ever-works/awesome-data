name: National Transfer Accounts – Browse Database
description: An international research project that maintains standardized
  National Transfer Accounts, quantifying how people at different ages produce,
  consume, and share economic resources. The browse database interface is listed
  in the Awesome Public Datasets economics section as a directory for
  age‑structured economic accounts data across countries.

  ## Overview


  The National Transfer Accounts (NTA) Browse Database is an online interface
  for accessing standardized age-structured economic accounts for countries
  around the world. NTA data quantify how people at each age produce, consume,
  share, and reallocate economic resources over the life cycle, linking
  individual age profiles with macroeconomic aggregates.


  The accounts:

  - Measure economic flows (production, consumption, transfers, asset-based
  flows) by single year of age.

  - Are reported in nominal terms in each country’s local currency.

  - Are constructed to be consistent, as far as possible, with the System of
  National Accounts for each country.


  The database is continuously updated with the most detailed and up-to-date NTA
  estimates submitted by national research teams.

  ## Features


  ### Core Data

  - **Age-specific economic flows**: Quantifies how much people at each age:
    - Produce through labor.
    - Consume goods and services.
    - Receive and give transfers.
    - Rely on assets (including debt) to fund consumption.
  - **Life-cycle focus**: Captures the characteristic pattern where children and
  older adults consume more than they produce, funded by:
    - Public transfers (e.g., through government programs).
    - Private transfers (e.g., within families).
    - Asset-based flows.
  - **Country-level series**: Data available for multiple recent years for each
  participating country.

  - **Consistency with National Accounts**: Accounts are designed to align with
  national macroeconomic aggregates where possible.

  - **Local currency, nominal values**: All flows are reported in nominal terms
  and in each country’s own currency.


  ### Database Contents and Outputs

  - **Country reports** (for selected countries):
    - Narrative and tabular documentation of the structure and construction of NTA for those countries.
    - Useful for understanding methodological details and context.
  - **Time-series indicators**:
    - Constructed by combining NTA data with population estimates and projections.
    - Support analysis of how changing population age structure affects economic flows and intergenerational transfers over time.
  - **Cross-sectional indicators**:
    - Derived exclusively from NTA.
    - Enable analysis of the relationship between age structure, development, and economic interactions at a point in time across countries.
  - **Applications**:
    - Specialized presentations and tools that provide innovative ways to view and interpret NTA data.

  ### Access and Interaction

  - **Browse database interface**:
    - Central access point for the NTA data and related indicators.
    - Offers structured menus for selecting countries, years, variables, and other filters (implied by the two-step download process).
  - **Two-step download workflow**:
    1. **Data selection**: Use an on-page menu to choose the desired subset of NTA data (e.g., by country, year, age range, or account component).
    2. **Data downloading**: Export the selected data in downloadable formats for offline analysis.
  - **Continuous updates**:
    - Database is updated as country teams submit revised or new estimates.

  ### Visualization and Comparison Tools

  - **NTA Data Visualization module**:
    - Allows comparison of NTA results across:
      - Countries.
      - World regions.
      - Income groups.
    - Provides graphical views of age profiles and indicators using the underlying NTA data.

  ### Documentation and Citation

  - **In-database documentation**:
    - Guidance on appropriate citations for country-specific datasets and indicators.
    - Supports proper attribution of the work of national research teams.
  - **Suggested general citation**:
    - Ronald Lee and Andrew Mason, lead authors and editors (2011), *Population Aging and the Generational Economy: A Global Perspective*, Edward Elgar.
    - Include the NTA website URL (www.ntaccounts.org) and date of access.

  ## Intended Use Cases


  - Research on intergenerational transfers and the generational economy.

  - Analysis of how demographic change (population aging, youth bulges) affects
  economic flows.

  - Comparative cross-country studies of age-specific consumption, labor income,
  and transfers.

  - Policy analysis regarding pensions, education, health, and family transfers.

  - Integration with population projections for long-term fiscal and economic
  modeling.
