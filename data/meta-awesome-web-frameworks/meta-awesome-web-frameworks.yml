  # Meta Awesome – Web Frameworks


  **Website:**

  **Category:** Meta-directories  

  **Tags:** web, framework, directory-of-directories


  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Web Frameworks is a curated, “awesome-style” sub-directory
  within the broader Meta Awesome collection. It focuses specifically on web
  frameworks and aggregates links to high‑quality resources and secondary
  awesome lists related to web framework technologies.


  ## Features

  - **Focused scope on web frameworks**  
    Concentrates only on resources and lists that are specifically about web frameworks, rather than general web development.

  - **Awesome-style organization**  
    Follows the common “awesome list” pattern (curated, community-oriented, markdown-based collections of links).

  - **Meta-directory of directories**  
    Acts as a higher-level index that points to:
    - Individual awesome lists about specific web frameworks
    - Secondary “awesome” collections that group multiple frameworks
    - Other curated directories relevant to web frameworks.

  - **Part of the Meta Awesome collection**  
    Integrated into the wider Meta Awesome project, which aggregates many domain-specific awesome lists.

  - **Markdown-based document**  
    Distributed as a markdown file (`web-frameworks.md`) in a public GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, fork, and contribute to.

  - **Open, GitHub-hosted resource**  
    Hosted on GitHub, enabling version control, issue tracking, and community contributions (pull requests, suggestions, updates).

  - **Framework-agnostic**  
    Not tied to a single framework or vendor; it functions as a neutral index across multiple ecosystems.

  ## Intended Use Cases

  - Discovering curated awesome lists about specific web frameworks.  

  - Exploring secondary collections that compare or group multiple frameworks.  

  - Using as a starting point for research into web framework ecosystems.


  ## Pricing

  - Not a commercial product or service.  

  - Access is free, as it is a public GitHub-hosted markdown directory.
