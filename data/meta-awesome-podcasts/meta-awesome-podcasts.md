## Overview
Meta Awesome – Podcasts is a higher-level index of "Awesome"-style curated lists specifically focused on podcasts. Instead of listing individual podcasts, it links out to many separate Awesome lists that each curate podcasts for a particular domain or topic.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of podcast lists**: Aggregates multiple Awesome-style lists that themselves curate podcasts.
- **Domain-focused organization**: Each linked list typically centers on a specific domain (e.g., technology, science, education, etc.), making it easier to browse podcasts by area of interest.
- **Awesome ecosystem integration**: Follows the familiar "Awesome" list format used across GitHub, aligning with community conventions.
- **Single entry point**: Acts as a central starting page for discovering a wide variety of podcast-related Awesome lists without having to search for them individually.
- **Open and community-driven** (implied by being a GitHub-hosted list): Can generally be forked, starred, and contributed to via pull requests, in line with typical Awesome list practices.

## Pricing
