## Overview
Awesome Motion UI Design is a curated, open-source directory of resources related to motion UI design, including animations and transitions in user interfaces. It aggregates inspiration sources, educational materials, tools, and technical libraries for designers and developers working with motion.

## Features

### Scope & Focus
- Curated collection focused specifically on **motion UI design**, **UI animations**, and **transitions**.
- Aims to cover both **conceptual** and **technical** aspects of motion in interfaces.
- Open contribution model via GitHub pull requests.

### Resource Categories
- **Resources for inspiration**
  - Example sites featuring motion design.
  - Pinterest boards centered on motion/interaction/animation.
  - Experimental work such as Processing and other unconventional/“weird but funny” motion explorations.

- **Articles**
  - Written resources covering theory, best practices, and techniques for motion UI.

- **Software** (for creating UI animations)
  - Organized by **technology** and **output format** (e.g., video, prototype, code).
  - Includes tools with:
    - Video, GIF, and presentation outputs.
    - Visual programming environments.
    - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based animation tools.
  - Mentions low‑tech methods such as **pen and paper** for planning motion.

- **Helpers**
  - Utilities and helper tools that support motion design workflows (e.g., converters, generators, measurement aids).  

- **Libraries**
  - **CSS animation libraries** (e.g., transitions, keyframe-based animations).
  - **JavaScript animation libraries** (e.g., timelines, physics-based motion, scroll-based animations).
  - **SVG-focused libraries** (e.g., path animation, drawing effects, morphing).

- **Web animation performance**
  - Resources on optimizing performance of animations in the browser.

- **Speeches, presentations, videos**
  - Talks and recorded sessions about motion design principles and implementation.

- **Newsletters, podcasts, screencasts**
  - Ongoing and episodic content for staying up to date with motion UI trends and techniques.

- **Guidelines**
  - Design guidelines and principles related to using motion responsibly and effectively in UI.

- **Books**
  - Longer-form reading resources about motion design and related topics.

### Licensing & Openness
- Content is released under the **CC0 (Public Domain)** license.
- Contributions are managed via a dedicated `contributing.md` file.

## Pricing
- **Free**: This is an open-source, free-to-use curated directory.

## Ideal Use Cases
- Designers seeking **inspiration** and reference material for motion in interfaces.
- Developers looking for **animation libraries** and performance tips.
- Product teams wanting **guidelines** and educational content to introduce or improve motion design in their products.
- Anyone researching or teaching **UI animation and motion design** concepts.
