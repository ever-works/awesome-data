  ## Overview
  fucking-awesome-awesomeness is a GitHub-based meta-collection that aggregates many "awesome" lists into a single, curated directory. It focuses on programming-related awesome lists and displays each source repository’s GitHub stars and forks, acting as a directory of directories for developers and researchers.

  ## Features
  - **Meta-directory of awesome lists**  
    - Collects links to multiple existing "awesome" GitHub repositories.  
    - Organizes entries into high-level sections such as:
      - Programming Languages
      - Programming Languages Package Manager
      - General (miscellaneous awesome collections)

  - **GitHub stats for each list**  
    - Shows star counts (`⭐`) for each referenced awesome list.  
    - Shows fork counts (`🍴`) for each referenced awesome list.  
    - Allows quick comparison of popularity and community engagement across lists.

  - **Curated and maintained structure**  
    - Repository layout includes common collaboration files:
      - `README.md` with the main curated list
      - `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines
      - `code-of-conduct.md` to define community behavior
      - CI/configuration files such as `.travis.yml` and `.varci.yml`
      - `Dangerfile` for automated checks during contributions
    - History of many commits, indicating ongoing evolution of the collection.

  - **Programming language coverage**  
    - Large set of programming-language-focused awesome lists, each with individual star/fork metrics (examples visible in the README under **Programming Languages** and **Programming Languages Package Manager**).  
    - Includes both high-star mainstream lists and smaller niche lists.

  - **General-purpose awesome lists**  
    - A "General" section with broader awesome lists (e.g., general development, tools, or topic-agnostic collections), each annotated with stars and forks.

  - **Open contribution model**  
    - Designed for community contributions through pull requests.  
    - Contribution and conduct guidelines provided via dedicated markdown files.

  ## Intended Use Cases
  - Discovering new awesome lists across many programming languages and topics.  
  - Comparing lists by GitHub popularity (stars/forks).  
  - Using as a starting point for research into tools, frameworks, or ecosystems, via their associated awesome lists.

  ## Pricing
  - **Free** – Open-source GitHub repository, accessible and usable at no cost.
