### Overview
Awesome Mac is a curated, community-maintained directory of macOS software. It organizes high-quality, often “premium” mac apps, tools, and related resources into structured categories, acting as a reference list for discovering useful applications on Apple’s desktop operating system.

### Features
- **Curated macOS software directory**  
  - Focuses on quality macOS applications, tools, and resources.  
  - Emphasis on “premium software in various categories.”

- **Category-based organization**  
  - Apps and tools are grouped into multiple categories (e.g., general apps, command-line tools, plugins, etc.).  
  - Helps users quickly locate software by type or use case.

- **Multiple documentation files**  
  - `README.md` as the primary English entry point.  
  - `README-zh.md` and other `*-zh.md` files provide Chinese-language versions for several sections.

- **Dedicated sections for developer tools**  
  - `command-line-apps.md` and `command-line-apps-zh.md` list command-line utilities for macOS.  
  - `editor-plugin.md` and `editor-plugin-zh.md` list editor/IDE plugins relevant to macOS workflows.

- **Web-friendly build & distribution setup**  
  - `build` and `dist` folders suggest the list can be generated or published as a static site.  
  - `idoc.yml` indicates configuration for documentation/site generation tools.

- **Community guidelines and governance**  
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` explains how to propose additions or changes.  
  - `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` defines interaction standards for contributors.

- **Open-source repository structure**  
  - Includes standard project files such as `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, and CI configuration (`.travis.yml`).  
  - `logo.svg` provides a recognizable project logo for use in documents or the generated site.

- **License information**  
  - A dedicated `LICENSE` file governs usage, contributions, and redistribution of the list and project assets.

### Pricing
