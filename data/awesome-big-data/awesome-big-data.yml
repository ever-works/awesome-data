  # Awesome Big Data


  A community-maintained, curated list of big data frameworks, tools, and
  educational resources, published as an open GitHub repository.


  - **Website/Repo:** https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata

  - **Category:** Themed directory (big data)

  - **Tags:** big-data, data-science, distributed

  - **Open Source:** Yes (see LICENSE in repository)


  ## Overview


  Awesome Big Data aggregates links to notable big data technologies and
  learning materials across the ecosystem. It is inspired by other "awesome"
  lists (awesome-php, awesome-python, awesome-ruby) and focuses on tools and
  frameworks used for large-scale data storage, processing, and analysis.


  ## Features


  - **Curated list format**
    - Manually curated collection of big data resources.
    - Community contributions accepted via GitHub.

  - **Broad coverage of big data stack** (sections in the list include, but are
  not limited to):
    - **RDBMS** – traditional relational database systems relevant in big data contexts.
    - **Frameworks** – general-purpose big data and analytics frameworks.
    - **Distributed Programming** – libraries and platforms for distributed/parallel data processing.
    - **Distributed Filesystem** – systems for distributed storage of large data sets.
    - **Distributed Index** – technologies for indexing and searching large-scale data.
    - **Document Data Model** – document-oriented databases.
    - **Key Map Data Model** – distributed, persistent databases centered around key→map-of-values data models (often called column family stores).
    - **Key-value Data Model** – systems exposing simpler key→value interfaces.
    - **Graph Data Model** – graph databases and graph processing tools.
    - **Columnar Databases** – systems that store data column-by-column rather than row-by-row.

  - **Conceptual clarifications and notes**
    - Distinguishes between:
      - Column-family-style stores (treated as **Key Map Data Model**), where each key maps to one or more maps of key–value pairs (often called column families and columns).
      - Storage-format-based **Columnar Databases**, where data is stored column-wise on disk or in memory to optimize column scans.
    - Provides references to external explanations, such as Prof. Daniel Abadi’s blog post on the two major types of column stores.

  - **Educational resources**
    - Includes learning materials and references for understanding big data concepts and tools (framework documentation, blog posts, ecosystem tables like hadoopecosystemtable, etc.).

  - **Ecosystem inspiration and cross-linking**
    - Inspired by multiple established "awesome" lists (awesome-php, awesome-python, awesome-ruby) and other big data overviews (e.g., hadoopecosystemtable, usefulstuff.io/big-data).

  - **License information**
    - Repository includes a `LICENSE` file specifying usage and redistribution terms.

  ## Pricing


  - Not applicable. This is a free, open GitHub list of links and resources.


  ## Ideal Use Cases


  - Discovering big data tools and frameworks by category.

  - Getting an overview of different data models (relational, key-value,
  document, graph, columnar, etc.).

  - Using as a starting point for exploring the big data ecosystem in research,
  learning, or project planning.

  - Contributing additional big data resources to a public, community-driven
  directory.
