  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Plugins is an Awesome-style meta collection that indexes other
  curated lists of plugins and extensions across multiple ecosystems. It serves
  as an entry point for discovering Awesome repositories specifically focused on
  plugins and extensions, rather than listing individual plugins itself.


  ## Features

  - **Meta index of plugin lists** – Aggregates links to Awesome-style lists
  that focus on plugins and extensions.

  - **Ecosystem-agnostic scope** – Covers multiple ecosystems and platforms
  (e.g., IDEs, frameworks, tools), depending on the underlying Awesome lists it
  references.

  - **Curated Awesome repositories** – Points to curated Awesome repositories
  rather than raw search results, emphasizing quality and organization.

  - **Entry point for plugin discovery** – Designed as a first stop to find more
  specialized plugin/extension lists for specific technologies or tools.

  - **Markdown-based documentation** – Distributed as a Markdown document
  (`plugins.md`) within a GitHub repository, easy to read, fork, or extend.

  - **Community-maintainable** – As part of a GitHub repo, it can be updated and
  expanded via pull requests and issues from the community.


  ## Pricing

  - **Free** – Public GitHub repository, accessible at no cost.
