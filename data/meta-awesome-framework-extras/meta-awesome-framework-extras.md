## Description
meta-awesome: Framework Extras is a curated meta-collection of lists that catalog auxiliary and add-on tools related to various software frameworks. It focuses on aggregating links to “awesome” style lists that cover plugins, extensions, utilities, scaffolding tools, and other extras that enhance or extend existing frameworks for developers.

## Features
- **Meta-collection of lists**: Aggregates multiple “awesome” or similar curated lists rather than individual projects.
- **Focus on framework ecosystems**: Targets tools and extras that sit around core frameworks (e.g., plugins, add-ons, integrations, helpers).
- **Developer-oriented**: Aimed at software developers looking to augment their existing framework stacks with additional utilities and tooling.
- **Broad coverage of frameworks**: Intends to cover a variety of frameworks across languages and domains (front-end, back-end, etc.).
- **Link-based index**: Each entry points to external lists or repositories maintained by the wider community.
- **Open, GitHub-hosted format**: Published as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, enabling easy browsing, forking, and contribution.
- **Community extensibility**: Structure supports additions and updates via pull requests to keep the meta-directory current.

## Pricing
- Not a commercial product or service; it is a free, open, GitHub-hosted meta-directory of links.
