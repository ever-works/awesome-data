  ### Meta Awesome - Modals and Popups


  **Category:** Meta Directories  

  **Brand:** jepemometa-awesome  

  **Source:**
  <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/modals-and-popups.md>


  #### Overview

  Meta Awesome – Modals and Popups is a curated meta-directory that aggregates
  “awesome lists” specifically focused on UI modals, popups, and overlay
  components. It acts as an index to other community-maintained lists rather
  than being a UI library itself.


  #### Features

  - **Meta-aggregation of lists**: Collects and links to multiple awesome lists
  related to modals, popups, and overlays.

  - **UI-focused scope**: Concentrates on user interface elements such as
  dialogs, lightboxes, tooltips, and other overlay components used on the web.

  - **Web development oriented**: Targets web developers and designers looking
  for libraries, patterns, and reference implementations for modals and popups.

  - **GitHub-hosted**: Maintained as part of the `meta-awesome` GitHub
  repository, benefiting from version control and community contributions.

  - **Taggable and searchable**: Can be discovered via tags like
  `meta-directory`, `ui`, and `web-development` within GitHub ecosystems.


  #### Content Structure (inferred)

  - Links to external awesome lists on modals and popups.

  - Short descriptions of each referenced list (where provided in the source
  lists).

  - Categorization likely by technology, framework, or type of UI overlay (e.g.,
  general JS, React, Vue, CSS-only, design patterns).


  #### Pricing

  - No pricing information is provided. As a GitHub-based meta-directory, it is
  typically free and open-source to browse and contribute to.
