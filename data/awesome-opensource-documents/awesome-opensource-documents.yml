  # awesome-opensource-documents


  Curated directory of open‑source or open‑licensed documents, guides, and books
  across technical and non‑technical domains. Every listed resource can be read,
  used, modified, translated, redistributed, or rewritten under its original
  open license.

  ## Overview


  **Type:** Themed directory / curated list  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Focus:** Open‑source / open‑licensed documents, guides, and books (not
  limited to programming)  

  **Source:** GitHub repository:
  https://github.com/hubtee/awesome-opensource-documents


  This directory is explicitly *not* a generic list of “free programming books”;
  instead, it focuses on materials whose source is openly licensed so you can
  adapt and reuse them.

  ## Features


  ### 1. Open‑licensed document focus

  - Only includes documents, guides, and books that are:
    - Open source or open‑licensed
    - Usable for reading, modification, translation, redistribution, and rewriting
    - Clearly tied to an identifiable license

  ### 2. Standardized entry template

  Each listed document follows a clear, consistent format:


  ```text

  [TITLE][repository-url] by AUTHOR ([SITE][site-url], LICENSE) - SHORT
  DESCRIPTION

  ```


  This helps users quickly see:

  - Title

  - Repository link

  - Author

  - Official site (if any)

  - License

  - Short description


  ### 3. Thematic organization by subject

  The list is organized into multiple subject areas to make discovery easier:


  - **Computer Science**

  - **Data Science**

  - **DevOps**

  - **Mathematics & Physics**

  - **Open Source** (meta‑resources about OSS itself)

  - **Programming** (general programming topics)

  - **Database**

  - **World Wide Web** (web technologies and related topics)

  - **Writing and Documentation**

  - **Journalism and Visualization**

  - **Android Development**

  - **iOS Development**

  - **etc.** (catch‑all for additional subjects beyond the main list)


  ### 4. Organization by programming language

  In addition to subject categories, the directory also groups documents by
  programming language, including (as listed in the table of contents):


  - **C**

  - **Coffeescript**

  - **CSS**

  - **Fortran**

  - **Ruby**

  - **Clojure**

  - **Erlang**

  - **Elixir**

  - **Forth**

  - **Go**

  - **Haskell**

  - **Javascript**


  (Additional languages may be present in the full README beyond what is visible
  in the provided excerpt.)


  ### 5. Contribution guidelines

  - A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file defines how to propose new entries or changes.

  - Encourages community curation and maintenance of the list.


  ### 6. Open licensing for the list itself

  - The repository includes a `LICENSE` file, specifying how the curated list
  itself can be reused.


  ### 7. GitHub‑based workflow

  - Hosted on GitHub for easy forking, starring, and contributions.

  - Uses standard GitHub structure (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`).
