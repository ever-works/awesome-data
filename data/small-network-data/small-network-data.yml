  ## Overview

  Small Network Data is a curated collection of small real‑world and synthetic
  network datasets maintained by M. E. J. Newman (University of Michigan). These
  datasets are widely used for teaching, experimentation, and rapid prototyping
  of network and graph algorithms.


  ## Features

  - **Curated dataset collection**
    - Focuses specifically on *small* networks suitable for quick experimentation.
    - Includes both real-world and synthetic graphs.
    - Maintained by network science researcher M. E. J. Newman.

  - **Educational focus**
    - Commonly used in teaching network science and graph theory.
    - Appropriate for classroom exercises, homework, and demonstrations.

  - **Algorithm prototyping & experimentation**
    - Small size enables fast iterations for algorithm development and testing.
    - Useful for benchmarking basic implementations before scaling to large datasets.

  - **Referenced in public dataset directories**
    - Listed in the Awesome Public Datasets collection and similar graph/network data lists.

  ## Usage Examples

  - Teaching concepts such as degree distributions, clustering, communities, and
  paths.

  - Testing and debugging graph algorithms (e.g., shortest paths, centrality,
  community detection).

  - Creating reproducible examples for papers, tutorials, or workshops.


  ## Source

  - **Primary listing:** [Awesome Public
  Datasets](https://project-awesome.org/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)


  ## Pricing

  - Not explicitly stated in the source listing; Awesome Public Datasets
  primarily catalogs publicly available datasets, many of which are free. Users
  should verify licensing and usage terms on the original Small Network Data
  host page.
