# Meta Awesome – ORM and Datamapping

**Website:** <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/orm-and-datamapping.md>

## Overview
Meta Awesome – ORM and Datamapping is a curated, “directory of directories” that aggregates links to multiple *awesome lists* focused on Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and data mapping patterns, tools, and libraries. It serves as a central entry point for discovering existing community-maintained resources around ORMs and database mapping across different languages and ecosystems.

## Features
- **Meta-directory structure**
  - Collects and organizes links to external *awesome lists* related to ORM and data mapping.
  - Acts as a hub rather than a single, monolithic list.

- **Focus on ORM and data mapping**
  - Targets resources specifically about ORM libraries, data mappers, and related patterns.
  - Useful for developers working with relational databases and object/data mapping layers.

- **Ecosystem-agnostic coverage**
  - Aggregates lists that may span multiple programming languages and frameworks (depending on what the underlying awesome lists cover).
  - Helps developers find ORM/datamapping tools relevant to their tech stack.

- **Community-maintained source**
  - Hosted on GitHub for transparency and collaboration.
  - Can be extended or updated via pull requests and issues in the repository.

- **Simple document format**
  - Provided as a Markdown document (`orm-and-datamapping.md`).
  - Easy to browse directly on GitHub or clone locally.
