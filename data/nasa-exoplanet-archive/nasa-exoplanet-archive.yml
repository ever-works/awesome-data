  ## Features


  ### Core Functionality

  - Open access archive of confirmed exoplanets and associated observational
  data

  - Focus on planetary systems and transit survey data

  - Large-scale time-series data (light curves) for exoplanet detection and
  analysis

  - Part of the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute services


  ### Data Collections

  - **Transit Surveys**
    - Over **130,041,578 light curves** available
    - Includes multiple major survey missions:
      - **TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite)**
        - All-sky transit survey launched April 2018
        - Targets bright, nearby stars to discover transiting exoplanets
      - **Kepler**
        - First space mission dedicated to searching for Earth-size and smaller planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars
        - Extensive archive of precision photometry and derived planet candidates
      - **K2 (Second Light of Kepler)**
        - Continuation of Kepler’s exoplanet discoveries
        - Expanded into broader astrophysical targets and fields along the ecliptic
      - **KELT (Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope)**
        - Transit survey focused on exoplanets around bright stars
        - Contains more than **6 million light curves** from both northern and southern hemispheres
      - **UKIRT Microlensing Survey (2015–2019)**
        - Microlensing data set with over **66 million targets**

  - **Planetary Systems**
    - Dedicated section for exploring multi-planet systems and host star properties (implied by navigation categories)

  - **Other Data Sets**
    - Additional surveys and data products grouped under “Other” (implied category for non-transit or complementary data)

  ### Search & Access Tools

  - **Advanced Search / Inventory Search**
    - Web-based advanced search interface for querying archive holdings
    - Linked help/documentation (`inventory_help.html`) for guidance on search parameters and usage

  ### Visualization & Plots

  - Pre-generated plots and visualizations (as indicated by sample images),
  including:
    - Scatter plots of orbital period vs. planet mass or radius
    - Histograms of discovery year (including cumulative distributions)
    - Scatter plots of period vs. radius for TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs)

  ### Tools & Services (High-Level)

  - “Tools & Services” area for working with archive data (exact tools not
  enumerated in the provided content, but presented as a distinct section)

  - “Work with Data” section indicating resources and interfaces for data
  retrieval and analysis


  ### Institutional & Program Context

  - Operated by the **California Institute of Technology (Caltech)**

  - Hosted at **IPAC** and associated with the **NASA Exoplanet Science
  Institute (NExScI)**

  - Funded and overseen under NASA’s **Exoplanet Exploration Program**
