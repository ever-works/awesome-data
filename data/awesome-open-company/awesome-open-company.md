## Overview
Awesome Open Company is a community‑curated directory of for‑profit organizations that operate with high levels of openness and transparency in their operations, finances, and culture. It follows the "awesome list" format popular on GitHub and focuses specifically on documenting and encouraging open company practices.

## Definition of an Open Company
For this directory, an **open company** is a for‑profit organization whose core practices are guided by:
- **Openness**
- **Transparency**
- **Interoperability**

This philosophy is summarized as:
> **Share as much as possible, charge as little as possible.**

The definition is inspired by the original formulation from Gittip (now Gratipay) and further elaborated through linked background resources in the repository.
