## Overview

Awesome Fiber is an open-source, community-maintained list that helps Go developers discover the Fiber ecosystem. It organizes officially maintained and third-party middleware, starter templates, code examples, tools, and educational content related to the Fiber web framework.

## Features

### Middleware Directory

Comprehensive listings of Fiber middleware, organized by origin and maintenance model:

- **Core middleware** (included in Fiber itself), such as:
  - `deflate`
  - `gzip`
  - `brotli`
- **External middleware**
  - Externally hosted modules maintained by the Fiber team.
- **Contrib middleware**
  - Third-party middleware packages maintained by both the Fiber team and community.
- **Third-party middleware**
  - Community-created middleware maintained independently.

This structure helps users distinguish between official, semi-official, and fully community-driven extensions.

### Boilerplates

- Collection of premade boilerplate projects for Fiber.
- Aimed at helping developers quickly start new applications with common setups (e.g., basic API, MVC structures, authentication, etc., depending on linked projects).

### Recipes

- Curated “recipes” (code examples and patterns) for solving common tasks in Fiber.
- Useful for learning idiomatic Fiber usage and implementing typical web application features.

### Tools

- Directory of tools that enhance or simplify working with Fiber, such as:
  - CLI helpers
  - Code generators
  - Debugging or profiling tools
  - Integrations with other services and frameworks (depending on linked projects).

### Learning Resources

- **Articles**
  - Community-written blog posts and tutorials about Fiber.
- **Videos**
  - Video tutorials and walkthroughs produced by the community.

These sections help developers learn Fiber concepts and best practices through external educational content.

### Benchmarks

- Links to benchmarks that compare Fiber with other Go and non-Go web frameworks.
- Useful for understanding performance characteristics and trade-offs.

### Community & Contribution

- **Contribution guidelines** documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for adding or updating entries.
- **Code of conduct** defining expected behavior in the community.
- Open to community contributions of new middleware, tools, articles, and example projects.
