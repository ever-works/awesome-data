  ## Overview

  Awesome CI/CD Attacks is a curated “awesome list” focused on offensive
  security research, techniques, and learning resources related to attacking
  CI/CD systems and software delivery pipelines. It aggregates links and
  references rather than providing tools or a hosted service.

    Gathers research papers, blog posts, talks, and write‑ups demonstrating real‑world CI/CD attack scenarios.

  - **Techniques and methodologies**  
    Highlights techniques used to compromise build systems, deployment pipelines, and related infrastructure.

  - **Resource aggregation**  
    Serves as a central directory of learning materials, tools, and references for CI/CD attack surface exploration.

  - **Community-driven awesome list format**  
    Follows the common "awesome list" style on GitHub, making it easy to browse, contribute, and reference from other repos.

  - **DevSecOps and supply-chain relevance**  
    Targets the intersection of DevOps and security, especially software supply-chain and pipeline abuse.

  ## Intended Audience

  - Security researchers analyzing CI/CD and software supply‑chain risks.

  - Red teamers and penetration testers simulating attacks on build and
  deployment systems.

  - DevOps and platform engineers seeking to understand how their pipelines
  might be abused.
