  ## Overview


  Awesome JAX is a curated, community-maintained directory of libraries,
  projects, and learning resources built around
  [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) — a high-performance machine learning
  framework that combines automatic differentiation and the XLA compiler via a
  NumPy-like API for GPUs and TPUs.


  ## Features


  - **Curated JAX ecosystem directory**
    - Organized list of JAX-related libraries, projects, and tools
    - Focus on high-performance machine learning and scientific computing
    - Emphasis on automatic differentiation and XLA-based compilation

  - **Library listings**
    - Highlights core and third-party JAX libraries
    - Includes frameworks and utilities built on top of JAX
    - Uses GitHub stars and project metadata (e.g., badges) for quick at-a-glance context

  - **Project and example collections**
    - References real-world projects using JAX
    - Helps discover example implementations and end-to-end workflows

  - **Learning and reference resources**
    - Links to tutorials, documentation, and educational material about JAX
    - Suitable for researchers, engineers, and learners exploring JAX

  - **Community-driven curation**
    - Open GitHub repository with contribution guidelines (`contributing.md`)
    - Code of conduct (`code-of-conduct.md`) to support healthy community interaction
    - Licensed content (`LICENSE`) for clear reuse terms

  ## Ideal Use Cases


  - Exploring the JAX ecosystem when starting a new ML or scientific computing
  project

  - Finding libraries and tools that build on JAX for specific tasks

  - Discovering learning resources to get up to speed with JAX and XLA

  - Benchmarking or comparing JAX-based projects via a single, organized list


  ## Pricing


  - **Free**: The directory and all its listings are freely accessible as a
  public GitHub repository.
