## Overview
Open Cognitive Science Data (OpenCogData) is an open, curated collection of publicly available cognitive task datasets. It focuses on behavioral and related data from cognitive science research and serves as a directory linking out to underlying data repositories (e.g., OSF, GitHub) and associated papers.

## Features
- **Curated dataset directory**
  - Aggregates publicly available behavioral and cognitive task datasets.
  - Organized as an online archive with individual entries per study.

- **Study-level entries**
  - Each entry typically includes:
    - Study citation (authors and year).
    - Study title.
    - Link to the published paper (e.g., via DOI).
    - Link to the dataset (e.g., OSF, GitHub).
    - Brief textual summary/abstract-like description of the study’s aims and findings.

## Data Types and Domain Focus
- Behavioral and cognitive task datasets.
- Emphasis on cognitive science domains such as:
  - Attention and statistical learning.
  - Working memory and action planning.
  - Language and predictive processing (e.g., ERP in sentence comprehension).
  - Social and economic decision-making (e.g., partner choice, responsibility attribution).

## Usage
- Acts as a directory; data are hosted on external repositories (e.g., OSF, GitHub) linked from each study’s page.
- Suitable for:
  - Reuse and reanalysis of cognitive science datasets.
  - Methods development, replication studies, and teaching resources.

## Pricing
- No pricing information is provided. The site and its listings are presented as an open, MIT-licensed resource.
