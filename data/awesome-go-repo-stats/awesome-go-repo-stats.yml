  ## Overview

  `awesome-go-repo-stats` is an open-source GitHub project that collects,
  analyzes, and exposes daily updated statistics for repositories listed in the
  `awesome-go` list. It acts as a meta-resource on top of the existing Awesome
  Go directory, providing data and analytics about listed Go repositories.


  ## Features

  - **Daily updated statistics** for repositories included in the `awesome-go`
  list.

  - **Data export files** in the repository root, including:
    - `analysis-latest.csv` – latest aggregated analysis of Awesome Go repositories.
    - `dep-repo-latest.csv` – dependency-related data for repositories.
    - `commits-history-30d.json` – commit activity history for the last 30 days.
    - `stars-history-30d.json` – stars history for the last 30 days.
    - `last-update.txt` – timestamp or marker of the last data update.
  - **Go-based tooling** (`main.go`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`) to fetch and process
  GitHub repository data.

  - **Website frontend** under the `website` directory to present and browse
  collected statistics.

  - **OpenTelemetry instrumentation** (under `otel_instrumentation`) for
  observability of the data collection and processing pipeline.

  - **GitHub workflow configuration** in `.github` for automated data updates
  and project CI/CD tasks.


  ## Use Cases

  - Analyzing trends (stars, commits) across Awesome Go repositories.

  - Identifying active or inactive projects within the Awesome Go list.

  - Building additional tools, dashboards, or visualizations on top of the
  exported CSV/JSON data.

  - Researching ecosystem health and activity in the Go open-source community.
