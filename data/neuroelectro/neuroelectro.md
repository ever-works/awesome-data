## Overview
Neuroelectro is a curated database that organizes and standardizes electrophysiological properties of diverse neuron types from the published neuroscience literature. It centralizes measurements such as resting membrane potential and membrane time constant to enable quantitative comparison across neuron types and the study of neuron-to-neuron relationships and functional diversity.

## Features
- **Centralized electrophysiology database**
  - Aggregates electrophysiological properties of neurons from existing scientific publications.
  - Focuses on cellular neurophysiology data.

- **Standardized neuron properties**
  - Includes properties such as:
    - Resting membrane potential
    - Membrane time constant
  - Standardizes reported measures to support cross-study comparisons.

- **Coverage of diverse neuron types**
  - Organizes data by neuron type, enabling systematic comparison across cell classes.

- **Quantitative neuron comparison**
  - Designed to facilitate quantitative comparison of electrophysiological properties across neuron types.

- **Neuron-to-neuron relationship exploration**
  - Supports discovery of neuron-to-neuron relationships (e.g., via clustering of neuron types).
  - Helps investigate functional diversity among neuron types.

- **Published literature integration**
  - Extracts and structures data specifically from peer-reviewed neuroscience literature.

- **Publications and resources**
  - Dedicated "NeuroElectro Publications" section listing scientific works related to or based on the database.

- **Project information**
  - Developed and maintained by researchers at the University of British Columbia and Arizona State University.
  - Identified release version: 5.0.
