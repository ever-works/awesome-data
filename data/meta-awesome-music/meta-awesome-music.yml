  **Category:** Meta-directories

  ## Overview

  meta-awesome – Music is a curated index of “awesome” lists and resources
  focused on music, audio, and sound processing. Hosted on GitHub, it aggregates
  links to many specialized awesome-lists and collections so users can discover
  tools, libraries, and educational resources across the broader music/audio
  ecosystem.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-index of awesome lists**
    - Aggregates multiple music- and audio-related awesome lists into one place.
    - Acts as a directory pointing to other curated collections rather than hosting all resources directly.

  - **Coverage of music, audio, and sound processing**
    - Focuses on topics such as music creation, audio programming, and sound processing.
    - Includes resources relevant to both music technologists and developers working with audio.

  - **GitHub-based curation**
    - Maintained as a markdown document within a GitHub repository.
    - Benefits from GitHub’s version control, issues, and pull requests for collaborative updating.

  - **Developer- and maker-oriented resources**
    - Emphasis on technical and open-source resources like libraries, tools, and reference material for working with audio.

  *(Note: the provided content does not include the detailed section list from
  the specific `music.md` file, so only high-level features can be described.)*


  ## Pricing

  plans mentioned).
