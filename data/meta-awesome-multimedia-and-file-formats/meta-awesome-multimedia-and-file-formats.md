## Overview
meta-awesome – Multimedia and File Formats is a subsection of the broader **meta-awesome** project. It aggregates and organizes links to curated “awesome lists” focused on:

- Multimedia processing and tooling
- Audio, image, and video handling
- File formats and related utilities

The goal is to act as a meta-directory, helping users quickly discover specialized awesome lists instead of searching for each one individually.

## Features

  Collects multiple independent awesome lists into a single reference page specific to multimedia and file formats.

- **Focus on multimedia domains**  
  Covers awesome lists related to handling and processing of:
  - Audio
  - Images
  - Video
  - General multimedia workflows

- **Coverage of file formats and tooling**  
  Includes awesome lists that focus on:
  - Specific file formats (e.g., codecs, containers, document formats)
  - Libraries and tools for parsing, converting, and generating files

- **Curated, GitHub-based references**  
  All entries are GitHub-hosted awesome lists or similar curated repositories, making it easy to explore source code, stars, and community activity.

- **Part of the broader meta-awesome structure**  
  Integrates with other meta-awesome sections (e.g., for different domains or technologies), providing a consistent way to navigate across categories.

- **Taggable and categorizable**  
  Classified under tags such as:
  - `meta-directory`
  - `multimedia`
  - `awesome-lists`

- **Open, editable source**  
  Maintained as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, allowing contributions, pull requests, and issue-based discussion.
