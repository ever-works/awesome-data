    - *Blockchain* – overview of blockchain as a cryptographically linked list of records (blocks).
    - *Artificial Intelligence* – high-level definition and scope of AI.
    - *Machine Learning* – definition and description of ML as data-driven, pattern-based modeling.

  - **Blockchain, AI and Machine Learning (articles & essays)**
    - **“Decentralizing AI: Dreamers vs. Pragmatists”** – Jesus Rodriguez (May 23, 2019), discussion of decentralizing AI.
    - **“How the Blockchain Could Break Big Tech's Hold on A.I.”** – New York Times (Oct 20, 2018), about blockchain’s potential impact on AI concentration.
    - **“How to Actually Combine AI and Blockchain in One Platform”** – Hacker Noon (June 7, 2018), practical approaches to combining AI and blockchain.
    - **“Blockchain-based Machine Learning Marketplaces”** – Fred Ehrsam (Mar 13, 2018), exploration of ML marketplaces enabled by blockchain.
    - **“The convergence of AI and Blockchain: what's the deal?”** – Francesco Corea (Dec 1, 2017), high-level overview of the convergence.

  #### 3. Blockchains for AI Algorithms

  Projects focused on hosting, distributing, or coordinating AI algorithms via
  blockchain:


  - **SingularityNET** – https://singularitynet.io/
    - Distributed AI platform on the Ethereum blockchain.
    - Each blockchain node backs up an AI algorithm.

  - **Intuition Fabric** – https://intuitionfabric.com
    - Aims to democratize access to AI through a network of deep learning models.
    - Models are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
    - Access and coordination are handled through the Ethereum blockchain.

  - **OpenMined** – https://openmined.org/
    - Community focused on open-source tools for decentralized ownership of data and intelligence.
    - Enables training AI on data it never directly accesses (privacy-preserving / federated-style approaches).

  - **Raven Protocol** – https://www.ravenprotocol.com/  
    - (Entry included in the list; description in the source is truncated, but categorized under blockchains for AI algorithms.)

  #### 4. Application-Oriented Sections (Listed in Contents)

  While detailed entries are not fully shown in the provided excerpt, the
  directory explicitly organizes projects and references by domain:


  - **Blockchains for data** – likely focuses on decentralized data storage,
  data marketplaces, and data governance for AI.
