## Overview
`awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome` is a curated meta-list that collects multiple "awesome" lists of other awesome lists. It functions as a directory of directories, focusing specifically on aggregating existing meta awesome lists into one place.

If this level of recursion is excessive, the repository suggests using the primary [`awesome`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list instead.

- **Awesome ecosystem integration:** Built around the popular "awesome" list convention on GitHub.
- **Community-driven updates:** Hosted on GitHub, allowing contributions via standard GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests).
- **Documentation file:** Central content lives in `readme.md` for easy browsing in the repository.
