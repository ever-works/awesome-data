## Overview
Meta Awesome – Dependency Management Extras is an auxiliary curated list that complements a primary dependency management meta list. It focuses on additional, niche, or more specialized resources related to software dependency management, aimed at developers and maintainers who want broader coverage than standard lists provide.

## Features
- **Complementary meta list** – Designed to extend an existing main dependency management meta list rather than replace it.
- **Focus on dependency management** – Targets tools, practices, and references around managing software dependencies.
- **Additional and niche resources** – Highlights lesser-known, specialized, or domain-specific resources that might be omitted from broader lists.
- **Developer-oriented** – Tailored for developers, engineers, and toolsmiths working with build systems, package managers, and dependency workflows.
- **GitHub-hosted documentation** – Provided as a Markdown document within a GitHub repository for easy viewing, version control, and contributions.
- **Part of the Meta Awesome collection** – Fits into a broader ecosystem of meta-awesome pages that aggregate and cross-link curated lists on various topics.
