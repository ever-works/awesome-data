## Overview
Meta Awesome – REST and API is an Awesome-inspired meta list that aggregates curated directories and Awesome repositories focused on REST and broader API design and implementation. It acts as a central index to other high-quality lists and resources about building, designing, and working with APIs.

## Features
- **Meta directory of REST/API resources**  
  Aggregates links to other curated lists and directories rather than individual tools or libraries.

- **Awesome-style structure**  
  Follows the conventions of Awesome lists (grouped, curated links; focus on quality and relevance).

- **Coverage of REST and broader API topics**  
  Includes resources on RESTful API design, non-REST API paradigms, and general API development practices.

- **Focus on design and implementation**  
  Oriented toward API architecture, design patterns, and implementation guidance rather than product marketing.

- **GitHub-hosted, Markdown-based list**  
  Maintained as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, fork, and contribute.

- **Part of the larger Meta Awesome project**  
  One document within the broader Meta Awesome collection, which indexes many domain-specific Awesome lists.
