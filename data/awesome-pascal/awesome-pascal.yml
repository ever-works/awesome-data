  # Awesome Pascal


  **Website:** https://github.com/Fr0sT-Brutal/awesome-pascal#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** awesome-lists, developer-tools, pascal


  ## Overview

  Awesome Pascal is a curated, open-source directory of Delphi, FreePascal, and
  other Pascal-related frameworks, libraries, tools, and learning resources. It
  focuses on actively maintained, high‑quality Pascal projects, taking
  inspiration from the broader "awesome" list ecosystem.


  ## Key Characteristics

  - Focuses on **Delphi**, **FreePascal**, and other Pascal dialects

  - Includes **frameworks, libraries, tools, and educational resources**

  - Only **open‑source** and **freeware** projects are listed

  - Prefers **actively maintained** projects; older entries must be notably
  useful or unique


  ## Features

  - **Curated Project List**  
    - Organized collection of Pascal-related software and resources.  
    - Covers a wide variety of domains (e.g., frameworks, components, utilities, learning materials).

  - **Open-Source and Freeware Only**  
    - Restricts entries to projects that are open-source or freeware, ensuring inspectable and reusable code.

  - **Maintenance & Quality Criteria**  
    - Excludes most unmaintained projects (not updated for 3+ years) unless they are exceptionally useful or unique.  
    - Encourages a higher baseline of quality and relevance.

  - **Compiler/Language Compatibility Badges**  
    - Each listed project includes badges indicating supported **compilers** and **Pascal dialects** (e.g., Delphi versions, FreePascal/Lazarus).  
    - Compatibility info is based on project documentation rather than deep technical verification.

  - **Coverage of Large, Multi-Feature Projects**  
    - Recognizes that many large frameworks include multiple subsystems (e.g., HTTP servers with JSON parsing, logging, CLI parsing, database access, etc.).  
    - Allows **cross-listing** or notes so that a major project may appear in a primary section and be referenced in other relevant sections.  
    - Encourages users to **search by keyword** across the list to discover secondary features embedded in large projects.

  - **Community Contributions**  
    - Open to contributions via comments and pull requests.  
    - Contribution guidelines provided (e.g., through `contributing.md`).

  - **Standard Awesome List Conventions**  
    - Follows the general conventions of the Awesome ecosystem (e.g., `awesome.re` badge, structured README).  
    - Licensed under an open license (see `LICENSE` in the repository).

  ## Pricing

  - **Free**  
    - The list and all its contents are publicly available at no cost.  
    - All included projects are open-source or freeware, though individual projects may have their own licenses and usage terms.
