  **Category:** Meta Directories

  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome - OTP is a curated "meta-awesome" section that aggregates links
  to awesome-style collections focused on OTP (One-Time Password) and,
  potentially, OTP-related ecosystems such as Erlang/Elixir OTP. It serves as a
  directory of existing curated lists rather than an individual library or
  service.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-directory of OTP resources**  
    Collects links to multiple "awesome" lists related to One-Time Password tooling, libraries, and articles.

  - **Focus on security-related OTP content**  
    Emphasizes OTP as a security mechanism (e.g., 2FA, authentication, secrets handling), reflected in its tagging.

  - **Coverage of OTP in language ecosystems**  
    Intended to include or reference OTP resources in ecosystems such as Erlang/Elixir OTP where applicable.

  - **GitHub-based, open curation**  
    Hosted as part of the `jepemo/meta-awesome` GitHub repository, allowing community visibility, forking, and contributions via standard GitHub workflows.

  - **Documentation-style format**  
    Presented as a markdown document (`otp.md`), making it easy to browse within GitHub or render as part of larger documentation sets.
