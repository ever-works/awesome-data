## Overview
Meta Awesome - OTP is a curated "meta-awesome" section that aggregates links to awesome-style collections focused on OTP (One-Time Password) and, potentially, OTP-related ecosystems such as Erlang/Elixir OTP. It serves as a directory of existing curated lists rather than an individual library or service.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of OTP resources**  
  Collects links to multiple "awesome" lists related to One-Time Password tooling, libraries, and articles.

- **Focus on security-related OTP content**  
  Emphasizes OTP as a security mechanism (e.g., 2FA, authentication, secrets handling), reflected in its tagging.

- **Coverage of OTP in language ecosystems**  
  Intended to include or reference OTP resources in ecosystems such as Erlang/Elixir OTP where applicable.

- **GitHub-based, open curation**  
  Hosted as part of the `jepemo/meta-awesome` GitHub repository, allowing community visibility, forking, and contributions via standard GitHub workflows.

- **Documentation-style format**  
  Presented as a markdown document (`otp.md`), making it easy to browse within GitHub or render as part of larger documentation sets.
