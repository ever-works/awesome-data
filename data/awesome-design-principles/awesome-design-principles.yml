  ## Description

  Awesome Design Principles is a curated GitHub directory of design and
  experience principles. It aggregates high-level rules, guidelines, and
  reference materials that help designers and teams create more consistent,
  user-centered interfaces and experiences. The list is aimed at serving as a
  reference and source of inspiration when defining or refining design
  principles.


  ## Features

  - **Curated collection of design principles**  
    A maintained list of good design and UX principles sourced from various organizations, products, and practitioners.

  - **Focus on high-level guidance**  
    Emphasizes principles as overarching rules that guide detailed design decisions, rather than low-level UI patterns.

  - **Integration with design systems**  
    Highlights principles that are often documented within broader style guides, pattern libraries, and full design systems.

  - **Sections by content type**  
    - *Principles within bigger Design Systems*: Links to design systems that explicitly document their design or experience principles.  
    - *Articles about Design Principles*: Articles and writings discussing how to create, apply, or evaluate design principles.  
    - *Other Resources*: Additional references, tools, or lists related to design principles and experience guidelines.

  - **Open contribution model**  
    Contributions via pull requests and issues are encouraged, following published contribution guidelines.

  - **Documentation and community standards**  
    - `README.md` with the main list and structure.  
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing how to propose new entries or changes.  
    - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` defining expected behavior for contributors.  
    - `LICENSE.md` specifying reuse and sharing terms.

  - **Inspired by established "awesome" lists**  
    The structure and approach are inspired by the "Awesome Design Systems" directory, aligning with the broader Awesome list ecosystem.

  ## Use Cases

  redesign.
