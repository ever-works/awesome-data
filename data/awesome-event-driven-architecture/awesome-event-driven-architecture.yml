  # Awesome Event-Driven Architecture


  **URL:** https://github.com/lutzh/awesome-event-driven-architecture#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** architecture, software, awesome-lists


  ## Overview

  Awesome Event-Driven Architecture is a curated directory of high‑quality
  learning resources focused on event-driven software architecture and
  event-based systems. It aggregates articles, videos, tools, patterns, and
  related materials that explain how services collaborate via publishing and
  subscribing to events, reducing runtime coupling between services.


  ## Features

  - **Curated Awesome List**
    - Follows the "Awesome" list conventions and guidelines.
    - Emphasizes clarity of principles, terminology, and core concepts in event-driven architecture.
    - Prioritizes quality over quantity: aims to list the *best* resources, not all possible ones.

  - **Focus on Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**
    - Centers on architectures where services communicate through events.
    - Highlights approaches that reduce runtime coupling via publish/subscribe mechanisms.
    - Covers event-based systems in general, not tied to a single vendor or technology.

  - **Organized Content Structure**
    - **Articles**
      - *Foundational*: Core conceptual and introductory material.
      - *Experience Reports and Practicalities*: Real-world case studies, lessons learned, and practical implementation details.
    - **Videos**
      - *Foundational*: Talks and presentations that introduce or explain core EDA concepts.
      - *Experience Reports and Practicalities*: Video case studies and implementation-focused talks.
    - **Related Topics**
      - Section dedicated to adjacent or complementary subjects (e.g., likely reactive systems, messaging, integration patterns, etc., as linked from the main list).

  - **Contribution Guidelines**
    - Public contribution process via issues and pull requests.
    - Uses a highly curated review process to maintain quality and consistency.
    - Aligns with the Awesome Lists guideline that lists should be curated collections of the best resources.

  - **Open Source & Licensing**
    - Repository includes a LICENSE file (standard open-source license; details in the repo).
    - Publicly hosted mirror on GitHub of the primary Codeberg repository.

  - **Community & Updates**
    - Maintainer shares updates and related content via Mastodon, Bluesky, and LinkedIn.
    - Related blog available for deeper dives into reactive and event-driven systems.

  ## Pricing

  Not applicable. This is a free, open-source curated resource list.


  ## Ideal Use Cases

  - Learning the fundamentals of event-driven architecture.

  - Finding high-quality articles and videos for team education or internal
  workshops.

  - Discovering practical experience reports before adopting or evolving an
  event-driven system.

  - Building or refining an event-driven architecture and looking for patterns,
  tools, and terminology references.
