## Overview
Awesome 3D Semantic City Models is a curated, “awesome-style” list of open semantic 3D city and region models, with a strong focus on CityGML and similar formats. It centralizes high-quality, open 3D urban datasets from multiple institutions to make discovery and reuse easier for research, GIS, and 3D city modeling projects.

## Features
- **Curated directory of datasets**
  - Collects open data semantic 3D city and regional models.
  - Focus on CityGML and comparable semantic 3D urban data formats.
  - Aims to be a more complete list than scattered institutional resources.

- **Semantic 3D focus**
  - Emphasizes models with semantic information (e.g., buildings with attributes, not just geometry).
  - Useful for applications such as urban analysis, 3D reconstruction, GIS workflows, and city digital twins.

- **Aggregation of multiple sources**
  - Builds upon and complements existing lists and initiatives, including:
    - CityGML Wiki “Open Data Initiatives”.
    - TU Delft 3D open data / open cities.
    - Towards Data Science articles on open-source 3D semantical building models.

- **Open source repository**
  - Hosted on GitHub, enabling transparent updates and version control.
  - MIT license for open reuse and redistribution of the list itself.

- **Community contribution**
  - Open to pull requests and contributions of new datasets.
  - Provides contact email for maintainers.

- **Related tooling information**
  - Separate `software.md` subpage listing software and tools relevant for working with the listed 3D models.

- **Academic linkage**
  - Accompanied by a peer-reviewed paper: *“Reviewing Open Data Semantic 3D City Models to Develop Novel 3D Reconstruction Methods”* (ISPRS Archives, 2024).
  - Citable via the linked paper and Zenodo entry, useful for academic referencing.

## Data & Technology Focus
- **Domains:** GIS, 3D city modeling, urban data, 3D reconstruction research.
- **Data types:** Open semantic 3D city / region models (e.g., CityGML datasets).

## Pricing
- Access to the repository and the curated list is **free** (open source, MIT-licensed).
