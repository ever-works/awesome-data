  #### Overview
  `meta-awesome: Encoding and Compression` is a curated entry in the broader *meta-awesome* collection that focuses specifically on directories of resources related to encoding and compression. It aggregates links to “awesome” lists and similar directories that catalog compression algorithms, encoding techniques, and related libraries and tools.

  #### Features

  - **Compression coverage**: Targets lists about compression algorithms, libraries, tools, and related educational resources.
  - **Awesome list integration**: Built around the GitHub “awesome” list ecosystem, aggregating other awesome-style lists into one place.
  - **GitHub-hosted reference**: Maintained as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, clone, or contribute.
  - **Topical navigation**: Organized under the `encoding-and-compression.md` document within the meta-awesome collection, helping users quickly locate resources specific to this domain.
  - **Developer-oriented**: Aimed at developers, researchers, and engineers looking for comprehensive references on encoding and compression technologies.

  #### Pricing
  - Not applicable. This is an open, GitHub-hosted curated document with no pricing information indicated.
