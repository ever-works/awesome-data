  **Category:** Meta-directories  

  **Tags:** meta-directory, embedded


  ## Overview

  meta-awesome: Embedded Systems is a curated meta-list that aggregates “awesome
  lists” related to embedded systems development. It serves as a directory of
  community-maintained resources covering embedded hardware platforms, low-level
  software, and tooling.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-aggregation of awesome lists**  
    - Collects and links to multiple independent “awesome” lists focused on embedded systems.
    - Provides a single entry point instead of searching for each list individually.

  - **Embedded systems focus**  
    - Targets topics specific to embedded development, such as microcontrollers, real-time systems, firmware, and hardware-near programming.
    - Emphasizes hardware platforms and development boards commonly used in embedded work.

  - **Tooling and ecosystem coverage**  
    - Includes lists for IDEs, toolchains, debuggers, simulators, and related utilities used in embedded software development.
    - Surfaces resources for build systems, testing, and deployment in embedded contexts.

  - **Community-driven resources**  
    - Leverages GitHub’s awesome-list ecosystem so entries are typically maintained and updated by domain practitioners.
    - Uses standard awesome-list conventions (Markdown lists, categorized links, GitHub-based curation).

  - **Documentation-style format**  
    - Hosted as a Markdown document in the `meta-awesome` repository under `doc/embedded-systems.md`.
    - Easy to read, fork, or extend directly on GitHub.

  ## Intended Use

  - Discover specialized awesome lists for embedded hardware and firmware.

  - Use as a starting point for learning or researching embedded systems topics.

  - Bookmark as a hub for up-to-date embedded development resources.


  ## Pricing

  - Access is **free** (public GitHub document, open for viewing and forking).
