  ## Description

  Meta Awesome – High Performance is a curated sub-collection within the broader
  Meta Awesome project, focused on resources related to high‑performance

  third‑party lists and references so developers and researchers can discover
  performance‑oriented tools, frameworks, and learning materials in one place.


  ## Features

  - **Curated meta‑collection** of links and resources specifically about
  high‑performance computing and optimization.

  ecosystem of “awesome” lists.

  - **Focus areas include:**
    - High‑performance computing (HPC)
    - Code and system optimization
    - Performance tuning methodologies and tools
  - **Directory-style structure** (Markdown document) that points to external
  lists, repositories, and articles rather than providing tools itself.

  - **Open GitHub repository format**, allowing users to browse, clone, or fork
  the list.


  ## Use Cases

  - Finding comprehensive “awesome” lists about HPC and performance
  optimization.

  - Quickly surveying external tools and libraries for performance tuning.
