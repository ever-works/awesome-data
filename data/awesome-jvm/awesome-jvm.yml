  # Awesome JVM


  **Website:** https://github.com/deephacks/awesome-jvm#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** awesome-lists, developer-resources


  ## Overview

  Awesome JVM is a curated directory of low-level, performance-focused, and
  non-framework-related tools, libraries, languages, and resources for the Java
  Virtual Machine ecosystem.


  ## Structure

  The list is organized into two main sections:


  - **Technical Topics**
    - Bytecode
    - Garbage collectors
    - Load tools
    - Languages
    - Machine Learning
    - Memory and Concurrency
    - Metaprogramming
    - Native
    - Network
    - Nix tools
    - Profilers
    - Runtimes
    - Virtual Machines

  - **Resources**
    - Communities
    - Documentation
    - Media
    - People

  ## Features


  ### Bytecode

  Tools for JVM bytecode manipulation and analysis.


  - **asmtools**  
    Toolset used to develop utilities for creating and working with Java `.class` files.

  - **Byte Buddy**  
    Code generation library that creates Java classes at runtime without needing a Java compiler.

  - **Jitescript**  
    Bytecode generation library with an API style similar to BiteScript, oriented to programmatic generation of JVM bytecode.

  ### Garbage Collectors

  Garbage collectors and related references for the JVM.


  - **Azul Pauseless Garbage Collection**  
    A pauseless garbage collection approach aiming for continuous operation of Java applications.

  - **Balanced GC**  
    A garbage collection policy available in the JVM for IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.

  - **Epsilon GC**  
    A passive, non-compacting GC implementation with a bounded allocation limit and minimal runtime overhead (designed mainly for testing and benchmarking scenarios).

  - **G1 (Garbage-First Collector)**  
    A server-style garbage collector designed to meet pause-time goals while managing large heaps.

  - **Shenandoah**  
    An ultra-low-pause-time garbage collector focusing on concurrent operations to reduce GC pauses.

  - **ZGC**  
    A low-latency garbage collector optimized for very large heaps and minimal pause times.

  - **The Garbage Collection Handbook**  
    A reference book that covers modern garbage collection algorithms and the impact of recent hardware and software developments.

  ### Load Tools

  Tools for generating load and measuring system performance while avoiding
  coordinated omission.


  - **Gatling**  
    Asynchronous, non-blocking, scenario-based load-testing tool for HTTP servers.

  - **wrk2**  
    A constant-throughput load generator and latency-measurement tool designed to record correct latency distributions.

  ### Languages

  Languages that run on the JVM.


  - **Ceylon**  
    Object-oriented, strong, statically typed language with emphasis on immutability, created by Red Hat.

  - **Clojure**  
    A Lisp dialect for the JVM, dynamically typed, with a strong focus on functional programming and immutability.

  - **Erjang**  
    An Erlang virtual machine implemented on top of the JVM.

  - **Eta**  
    A pure functional language for the JVM based on Haskell (description truncated in source, but listed as a JVM language).

  ## Resources


  While specific entries aren’t enumerated in the provided excerpt, the Awesome
  JVM list also includes curated sections for:


  - **Communities** – user groups, forums, and community hubs around JVM
  internals and performance.

  - **Documentation** – technical references and specs relevant to JVM operation
  and tuning.

  - **Media** – talks, videos, podcasts, and other educational content.

  - **People** – notable contributors and experts in the JVM ecosystem.


  ## Pricing

  Not applicable. Awesome JVM is an open curated list of resources and tools; no
  pricing plans are indicated.
