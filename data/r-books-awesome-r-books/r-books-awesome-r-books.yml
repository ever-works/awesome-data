  # R Books (Awesome R Books)


  A curated, Awesome-style directory of books and reading material focused on
  the R programming language.


  ---


  ## Overview


  R Books is a structured collection of R-related books, organized to help
  learners and practitioners find resources by topic and skill level. The list
  modernizes an earlier “R Books” project in a more user-friendly format and is
  inspired by similar curated lists like GoBooks.


  **Main focus:** Books covering R programming, data analysis, data science, and
  domain-specific applications of R.


  **Primary source:** GitHub repository:
  https://github.com/RomanTsegelskyi/rbooks

  ## Categories


  The directory organizes books into these main sections:


  - **Beginner Books** – Introductory material for learning R and basic
  programming concepts.

  - **Advanced Books** – More in-depth resources for experienced R users
  (section listed; individual books not fully shown in the excerpt).

  - **Data Science** – R for data analysis, statistics, and data science
  workflows.

  - **Finance** – Using R for financial analysis and quantitative finance.

  - **Machine Learning** – R for predictive modeling and ML techniques.

  - **R Development** – Resources on R package development and advanced
  programming in R.
