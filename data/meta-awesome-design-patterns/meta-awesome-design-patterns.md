### Overview
Meta Awesome – Design Patterns is a curated, “awesome-style” meta-collection of resources focused on software design patterns. It aggregates and references multiple external awesome lists, pattern catalogs, and best-practice guides, serving as a central index for learning and applying software design and architecture patterns.

### Features
- **Meta-collection format** – Acts as an index over many existing "awesome" lists and external resources rather than a single, standalone list.
- **Focus on software design patterns** – Concentrates on classic and modern software design patterns, including structural, creational, behavioral, and architectural patterns.
- **References to multiple resources** – Links out to:
  - Pattern catalogs
  - Best-practices guides
  - Other awesome lists related to design and architecture
- **Best-practices orientation** – Emphasizes resources that not only list patterns but also explain usage, trade-offs, and implementation practices.
- **Architecture-focused tagging** – Organized around themes of design and architecture, helping users discover higher-level architectural pattern resources in addition to low-level design patterns.
- **Open GitHub-hosted document** – Provided as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, clone, or contribute.

### Pricing
- Not applicable – this is an open, GitHub-hosted resource with no listed pricing or plans.
