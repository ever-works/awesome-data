**Tags:** awesome-lists, developer-resources, directory-of-directories

## Overview
Meta Awesome – Development is a curated meta-directory that aggregates multiple "awesome" lists related to general software development. It serves as a central index for high-quality resources on coding practices, tooling, workflows, and other development topics.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of awesome lists**
  - Collects and links to many separate "awesome" lists focused on software development.
  - Functions as a directory-of-directories so developers can discover curated lists in one place.

- **General software development scope**
  - Covers broad development topics rather than a single language or framework.
  - Focuses on coding practices, development workflows, and tooling ecosystems.

- **Developer tooling and workflows**
  - Includes lists related to tools that support the software development lifecycle (e.g., editors/IDEs, automation tools, CI/CD, issue tracking, code review tools).
  - Surfaces resources that help streamline developer workflows and project management.

- **Security and quality related resources**
  - Points to lists that include application security tools and practices (e.g., code security, secret protection, vulnerability discovery).
  - Helps developers find resources for improving code quality and securing applications during development.

- **AI and modern development topics**
  - May include lists related to AI-assisted coding, intelligent tooling, and modern dev environments.
  - Supports exploration of newer areas like AI code creation, cloud dev environments, and advanced automation.

- **Cross-cutting development topics**
  - Can link out to resources organized by use case (DevOps, DevSecOps, CI/CD, app modernization) and industry contexts.
  - Helps developers navigate articles and tools by topic (AI, software development, DevOps, security, and more) via the referenced awesome lists.

## Pricing
- Not applicable. Meta Awesome – Development is an open, GitHub-hosted meta-directory of resources and does not list pricing plans.
