  # Awesome Esolangs


  **URL:** https://github.com/angrykoala/awesome-esolangs#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** fun, programming-languages, education


  ## Overview

  Awesome Esolangs is a curated, community-driven directory of esoteric
  programming languages (esolangs), along with related resources, tools, and
  references. It focuses on languages created for experimentation, conceptual
  exploration, difficulty, or humor rather than practical software development.


  > “An esoteric programming language, or esolang, is a computer programming
  language designed to experiment with weird ideas, to be hard to program in, or
  as a joke, rather than for practical use.” — esolang.org


  ## Features


  ### Curated Esoteric Language Directory

  - Organized list of esoteric programming languages (esolangs).

  - Emphasis on experimental, unconventional, and joke languages.

  - Each entry typically links out to language definitions, home pages, or
  documentation (via the underlying GitHub README content).


  ### Structured Content Sections

  The repository structures information into clear sections:

  - **Languages** – Collection of individual esolangs.

  - **Algorithms** – Esoteric or language-related algorithmic examples and
  resources.

  - **Others** – Miscellaneous esolang-related items that don’t fit into other
  categories.

  - **Resources** – General resources about esolangs, such as indexes,
  documentation, and tools.

  - **Articles** – Articles, write-ups, and explanatory material related to
  esoteric programming.

  - **Community** – Links to community spaces around esolangs (forums, chats, or
  related community hubs).


  ### Repository & Project Resources

  - **README-based index:** Main list and descriptions are maintained in
  `README.md`.

  - **Contribution guidelines:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` explains how to propose new
  entries or changes.

  - **License file:** `LICENSE` specifies terms for using and contributing to
  the list.

  - **Project configuration:** Includes files like `.travis.yml` for CI-related
  configuration.


  ### Visual Identity

  - **Logo:** Uses a Piet-themed logo (`logo_piet.png`), credited and used with
