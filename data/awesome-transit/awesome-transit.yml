  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** awesome-lists, GIS, transportation


  ## Overview

  Awesome Transit is a curated, community-maintained directory of data
  standards, APIs, applications, tools, datasets, research, and software related
  to open technology for public transportation. It focuses on projects that are
  open source and/or built around open transit data and standards.


  ## Features


  ### Scope and Focus

  - Concentrates on the open technology ecosystem for public transit.

  - Includes items that are:
    - Open source projects, and/or
    - Based on open standards, and/or
    - Using open transit data.
  - Covers multiple stakeholder needs across agencies, developers, researchers,
  and tool builders.


  ### Content Types Covered

  - **Data standards** relevant to public transportation.

  - **APIs** for accessing transit and multimodal data.

  - **Applications** (apps and tools) built around transit data.

  - **Datasets** and data resources for transit analysis and applications.

  - **Research** connected to open transit technology.

  - **Software libraries and utilities** across programming languages.


  ### Organizational Structure

  The list is organized into themed sections, including:


  #### Producing Data

  - **GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)**
    - **GTFS Courses** – educational resources for learning and working with GTFS.
    - **GTFS Consumer App Guidance** – guidance and best practices for apps that consume GTFS data.
    - **GTFS Libraries** – software libraries to consume GTFS data in various languages:
      - C
      - C++
      - C#
      - Go
      - Java
      - JavaScript (e.g., working with `calendar.txt`, `calendar_dates.txt`)
      - PostgreSQL
      - Python
      - R
      - Ruby
      - Rust
    - **GTFS Converters** – tools to convert between GTFS and other static schedule formats.
    - **GTFS Data Collection and Maintenance Tools** – software to build, edit, and maintain GTFS feeds.
    - **GTFS Merge Tools** – tools for merging or combining multiple GTFS feeds.
    - **GTFS Analysis Tools** – software for analyzing GTFS feeds (e.g., service levels, coverage).
    - **GTFS Timetable Publishing Tools** – tools to generate human-readable timetables from GTFS.
    - **GTFS Validators** – tools to check GTFS data quality and specification compliance.

  - **GTFS Realtime**
    - **GTFS Realtime Libraries & Demo Apps** – libraries and example applications for consuming GTFS Realtime.
    - **GTFS Realtime Validators** – tools to validate GTFS Realtime feeds.
    - **GTFS Realtime (and other real-time API) Archival Tools** – tools to archive real-time transit data.
    - **GTFS Realtime Converters** – converters for real-time formats (e.g., managing `DIFFERENTIAL` vs `FULL_DATASET`).
    - **GTFS Realtime Utilities** – supporting utilities for processing or managing GTFS Realtime data.

  - **SIRI**
    - Section dedicated to tools and resources around the SIRI (Service Interface for Real Time Information) standard.

  - **Other Multimodal Data Formats**
    - **Widely adopted formats** – resources and tools for common multimodal data standards beyond GTFS/SIRI.
    - **Pilot or development stage formats** – references to emerging or experimental multimodal data formats.

  #### APIs and Backends

  - **Software for Creating APIs**
    - Tools and frameworks you can deploy to expose transit and multimodal data through APIs.

  ### Community and Maintenance
