  ## Overview


  Penn World Table (PWT) 11.0 is an internationally comparable database of
  national accounts, providing measures of income, output, inputs, and
  productivity for 185 countries from 1950 to 2023. It is widely used for
  macroeconomic and productivity research, especially for cross-country
  comparisons and growth analysis.


  PWT 11.0 is a major update to PWT 10.01; details of changes are documented in
  the “What is new in PWT 11.0” document.

  ## Features


  ### Coverage & Content


  - Time series for **185 countries** from **1950–2023**

  - Measures of:
    - **Real GDP** (multiple concepts and methods)
    - **Output and inputs** (e.g., capital and labour, though specific breakdowns are detailed in the full documentation)
    - **Productivity** measures
    - **Price levels and purchasing power parities (PPPs)**
  - Consistent, internationally comparable data, suitable for cross-country and
  over-time analysis.


  ### Selected Core Variables (examples)


  The online tool provides “selective data access” for specific variables.
  Examples include:


  - **RGDPNA**  
    - *Description:* Real GDP using national-accounts growth rates.  
    - *Use:* Comparing output-based growth rates across countries (e.g., dependent variable in cross-country growth regressions).

  - **CGDPe**  
    - *Description:* Expenditure-side real GDP at current PPPs.  
    - *Use:* Comparing relative living standards across countries at a single point in time (e.g., initial level in growth regressions requiring relative living standards).

  - **CGDPo**  
    - *Description:* Output-side real GDP at current PPPs.  
    - *Use:* Comparing relative productive capacity across countries at a single point in time (e.g., initial level in growth regressions requiring productive capacity or productivity).

  - **RGDPe**  
    - *Description:* Expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs.  
    - *Use:* Comparing relative living standards over time and across countries with a time-consistent PPP basis.

  (Additional variables and detailed definitions are listed in the User Guide
  and the online data tool.)


  ### Access & Integration
