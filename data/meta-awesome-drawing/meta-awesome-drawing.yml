  # Meta Awesome – Drawing


  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Drawing is a curated meta-list aggregating “awesome-style”
  lists focused on drawing, graphics, and rendering libraries and tools. It
  serves as a directory that points to multiple specialized awesome lists in the
  broader graphics and drawing ecosystem.


  - **Item type:** Meta-directory / curated list

  - **Category:** Meta-directories

  - **Topics:** Drawing, graphics, rendering libraries, tools

  - **Source:** [GitHub – meta-awesome drawing
  list](https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/drawing.md)


  ## Features

  - **Meta aggregation:** Collects and links to multiple existing awesome lists
  related to drawing and graphics, rather than listing tools directly.

  - **Drawing & graphics focus:** Concentrates on libraries, tools, and
  resources for drawing, graphics, and rendering workflows.

  - **Awesome-list format:** Follows the common “awesome list” convention on
  GitHub (markdown-based, link-focused, community-editable structure).

  - **Tooling coverage:** Targets a wide range of drawing and rendering tooling
  (e.g., libraries, frameworks, utilities) as they appear in the underlying
  awesome lists.

  - **Single entry point:** Provides one centralized document so users can
  discover related awesome lists in the drawing/graphics domain from a single
  location.

  - **Open and extensible:** Hosted on GitHub, allowing community contributions
  (issues/PRs) to expand or refine the referenced awesome lists.
