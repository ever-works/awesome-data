## Overview
Meta Awesome – Editor Plugins is a curated “meta index” that aggregates multiple awesome lists focused on plugins and extensions for various code editors. Instead of listing plugins directly, it points to separate, specialized awesome lists, making it easier to discover editor-specific plugin collections in one place.

## Features
- **Meta index of editor plugin lists**
  - Collects links to existing awesome lists dedicated to editor plugins and extensions.
  - Focuses on code editors (e.g., VS Code, Vim, Emacs, and others, depending on the linked lists).

- **Directory-of-directories structure**
  - Functions as a higher-level directory that points to multiple underlying directories (awesome lists) rather than individual plugins.
  - Helps users navigate to the right ecosystem-specific list instead of searching each editor community separately.

- **Curated awesome lists**
  - Only includes lists that follow the “awesome list” style of community curation.
  - Emphasizes quality and usefulness by aggregating established community-maintained resources.

- **Editor-agnostic access point**
  - Central entry point for discovering plugins across many editors from a single document.
  - Useful for developers who use multiple editors or are evaluating new tools.

- **Open, GitHub-based resource**
  - Hosted as a Markdown document in a public GitHub repository.
  - Benefits from GitHub’s ecosystem for discoverability, viewing, and potential contributions (issues, pull requests) subject to the repository’s contribution guidelines.

## Pricing
- **Cost:** Free to access (public GitHub document).
