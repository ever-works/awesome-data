  **Brand:** StudyForrest


  ## Overview

  StudyForrest is a large, open neuroimaging dataset collection acquired while
  participants watched the movie *Forrest Gump*. It is designed to support
  research on naturalistic stimulation and brain function, enabling
  investigations of how the human brain processes complex, real-world-like
  audiovisual input.


  ## Features

  - **Naturalistic stimulation paradigm**
    - Uses the commercial movie *Forrest Gump* as a rich, continuous audiovisual stimulus.
    - Captures complex, real-life-like sensory, contextual, and narrative information.

  - **Extensive fMRI data**
    - Many hours of functional MRI (fMRI) data per participant.
    - Some individuals have nearly ten hours of fMRI recordings.
    - Suitable for studies of both low-level signal properties and high-level cognitive processes.

  - **Structural brain imaging**
    - Includes structural MRI scans to study brain anatomy and structure.

  - **Eye-tracking data**
    - Eye movement recordings acquired while participants watched the movie.
    - Enables analysis of visual attention and gaze behavior in naturalistic viewing.

  - **Rich annotations of the movie**
    - Detailed annotations describing the structure and properties of *Forrest Gump*.
    - Supports research topics beyond neuroscience (e.g., film structure, narrative analysis, multimodal annotation studies).

  - **Multi-modal, modular dataset**
    - Combines fMRI, structural MRI, eye-tracking, and movie annotations.
    - Organized to allow modular use of different data subsets.

  - **Use cases for neuroscience researchers**
    - High-level cognition under complex, natural stimulation.
    - Low-level signal properties and brain structure.
    - Sensory integration and attentional processes.
    - Computational modeling of representational spaces and brain area interactions.

  - **Use cases for scientific developers**
    - Serves as an “ideal reference dataset” for brain imaging.
    - Suitable for benchmarking algorithms and comparing implementations across projects.
    - Can be integrated into continuous integration (CI) workflows.

  - **Access and licensing**
    - Liberally licensed under the Open Data Commons PDDL.
    - Hosted across multiple services (e.g., OpenNeuro, GIN) with fine-grained access options.
    - Content on the website is generally CC BY-SA (unless indicated otherwise).

  - **Community and usage**
    - Has been used in over two dozen published studies for both methodological and substantive research.
    - Website provides a list of publications and a data page detailing available resources.

  ## Pricing

  - No pricing information is provided. The dataset is described as “liberally
  licensed” under PDDL, indicating open data access rather than a paid pricing
  model.
