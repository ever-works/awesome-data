  # Meta Awesome – Input


  **URL:** https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/input.md  

  **Category:** Meta Directories  

  **Tags:** meta-directory, input, developer-tools


  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Input is a curated, Awesome-style subcollection within the Meta
  Awesome project that focuses on input: how users and systems provide data or
  commands. It aggregates links to input methods, input hardware, and software
  libraries that handle or interpret input, aimed primarily at developers and
  technical users.


  ## Features

  - **Awesome-style directory**
    - Follows the “Awesome list” convention: organized, link-based curation of external resources.
    - Hosted as part of the broader Meta Awesome collection.

  - **Focus on input methods**
    - Covers various ways users or systems can provide input (e.g., text, gestures, devices, other interaction modes).  
    - Intended to help developers discover tools and references for handling input in applications.

  - **Coverage of input devices**
    - Includes resources related to hardware or peripheral devices used for input (e.g., keyboards, pointing devices, specialized controllers, accessibility hardware), as documented in the list.

  - **Input-handling libraries**
    - Curates libraries and frameworks that process, interpret, or route input in software projects.
    - Oriented toward developer integration rather than end-user applications.

  - **Part of a larger meta-collection**
    - Integrated into Meta Awesome, which organizes multiple topic-specific Awesome-style lists.
    - Benefits from common structure, navigation, and categorization across the Meta Awesome project.

  ## Intended Audience

  - Software developers and engineers looking for libraries and tools to handle
  input.

  - Researchers or practitioners exploring input methods and devices.

  - Builders of applications, interfaces, or systems needing a structured
  reference to input-related resources.


  ## Pricing

  - Not a commercial product or service.  

  - Public GitHub documentation/list; no pricing or paid plans are associated
  with this directory itself.
