  ## Features


  ### Curated RNN Resource Directory

  - Focuses specifically on **Recurrent Neural Networks** and closely related
  deep learning topics.

  - Aggregates links to code, theory, and applications across multiple domains.

  - Organized as an “awesome list” for quick scanning and discovery.


  ### Structured Table of Contents

  Resources are grouped into clearly labeled sections:


  1. **Codes**
     - Links to RNN code repositories and implementations (e.g., frameworks, example projects, reference implementations).

  2. **Theory**
     - **Lectures**: Curated lecture notes, slide decks, and recorded talks explaining RNNs and sequence models.
     - **Books / Thesis**: Longer-form resources such as textbooks, monographs, and theses covering RNNs or sequence modeling.
     - **Architecture Variants**:
       - **Structure**: Materials on different RNN structural variants (e.g., bidirectional RNNs, stacked RNNs, sequence-to-sequence models, etc., as covered by the list).
       - **Memory**: Resources on RNNs with memory mechanisms (e.g., LSTM, GRU, attention-augmented models, and related variants referenced in the list).
     - **Surveys**: Survey and overview papers summarizing RNN methods and applications.

  3. **Applications**
     - **Natural Language Processing**
       - **Language Modeling**: RNN-based language modeling resources.
       - **Speech Recognition**: RNN approaches to acoustic and end-to-end speech recognition.
       - **Machine Translation**: Sequence-to-sequence and related RNN-based translation systems.
       - **Conversation Modeling**: Dialogue and conversational models powered by RNNs.
       - **Question Answering**: RNN-centric QA systems and reading comprehension models.
     - **Computer Vision**
       - Contains subsections (e.g., object recognition and other sequence-based vision tasks) dedicated to RNN applications in vision, as listed in the repository.
