## Overview

Awesome Pest is an open, community-maintained list of links related to the **pest** parser generator for Rust. It focuses on discovering learning materials, libraries, tools, and real-world projects that use pest and its parsing expression grammar (PEG) approach.

`pest` itself is a general-purpose parser written in Rust, designed around:
- **Accessibility** – readable grammars and approachable syntax.
- **Correctness** – reliable parsing for complex languages.
- **Performance** – efficient parsing using PEG-based grammars.

The list is curated and contributions are encouraged via documented contribution guidelines and a code of conduct.

## Features

### Directory Scope
- **Curated resources** for learning and using pest.
- **Projects showcase** of applications and libraries built with pest.
- **Tools listing** supporting pest-based development (e.g., debuggers, editors, utilities).
- Organized contents sections (e.g., *Resources*, *Projects*, *Tooling* as indicated in the README).

### pest Parser Ecosystem Focus
- Targets the **pest** parser generator written in Rust.
- Highlights usage of **parsing expression grammars (PEG)** for defining grammars.
- Emphasizes pest’s strengths:
  - Readable grammar definitions.
  - Ability to parse complex languages beyond regular expressions.
  - General-purpose applicability in Rust projects.

### Community & Governance
- **Open contributions** via a public `contributing.md` guide.
- **Community standards** defined in a `code-of-conduct.md` file.
- **Open license**: CC0-1.0, allowing free reuse of the list’s contents.

### Repository Assets
- **README-based index** used as the main directory page.
- Additional documentation files for:
  - Contribution process.
  - Code of conduct.
  - Debugger information (`debugger.md`) associated with pest tooling.

## Tooling & Debugging

While full details are in the repository, the presence of `debugger.md` indicates:
- Dedicated documentation for **pest-related debugging tools**.
- Guidance or references for debugging grammars or parsers built with pest.

These tools are likely included or referenced in the "Tooling" section of the awesome list.
