## OSU Cognitive Modeling Repository Datasets

**Category:** Datasets  
**Domain:** Psychology, Cognitive Science  
**Source:** Ohio State University Cognitive Modeling Repository  
**Directory Listing:** Included in the awesomedata / apd-core “Awesome Public Datasets” under Psychology and Cognition

### Overview
The OSU Cognitive Modeling Repository Datasets are a collection of publicly accessible behavioral datasets curated for cognitive psychology and cognitive modeling research. Hosted by the Ohio State University Cognitive Modeling Repository, these datasets support empirical and theoretical work in cognition, providing standardized data suitable for model development, testing, and comparison.

### Features
- **Behavioral focus**: Data centered on human behavioral and cognitive processes, suitable for cognitive psychology and cognitive science studies.
- **Cognitive modeling oriented**: Curated explicitly for use in cognitive modeling (e.g., fitting and comparing cognitive models to human data).
- **Publicly accessible**: Designed for open access to researchers, educators, and students (via the OSU repository, referenced through the Awesome Public Datasets list).
- **Curated collection**: Datasets are maintained as part of an organized cognitive modeling repository at Ohio State University, implying consistent structure and research-grade quality.
- **Indexed in Awesome Public Datasets**: Listed in the `awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets` repository under Psychology and Cognition, making it easier to discover and integrate into data-centric workflows.
- **Research use cases**: Suitable for tasks like model fitting, parameter estimation, validation of cognitive theories, replication studies, method benchmarking, and educational assignments in cognitive science.

### Use Cases
- Academic research in cognitive psychology and cognitive science.
- Development and evaluation of cognitive and computational models of behavior.
- Teaching datasets for courses on cognitive modeling, experimental psychology, or data analysis in psychology.
- Benchmark datasets for comparing modeling frameworks or inference methods.
