## Description
Awesome Yew is an open-source, curated list focused on the Yew framework, a modern Rust framework inspired by Elm and React for creating multi-threaded frontend applications compiled to WebAssembly. The list aggregates official resources, community projects, tooling, and learning materials relevant to Yew and WebAssembly.

## Features

### Curated Resource Categories
- **Official**
  - Links to official Yew resources (e.g., main repository, docs, and related official materials).

- **Projects**
  - Example and production projects built with Yew.
  - Demonstrations of:
    - Function components
    - Hooks
    - Demo apps
    - Getting started examples (`Start`).

- **Templates**
  - Starter templates and boilerplates for new Yew applications.
  - Example: usage pattern like `npx create-yew-app my-app` for quickly scaffolding a Yew project.

- **Crates**
  - Rust crates that extend or support Yew development, organized into subcategories:
    - **Component Libraries**
      - Collections of reusable UI components for Yew (e.g., `stylist` for styling).
    - **Components**
      - Individual Yew components that can be reused across projects.
    - **Hooks**
      - Custom hooks for state and side-effect management in Yew.
    - **JavaScript Library Ports**
      - Ports or bindings of popular JavaScript libraries for use with Yew/WebAssembly.
    - **Utils**
      - Utility crates to support common patterns and tasks in Yew apps.
    - **Wasm**
      - WebAssembly-focused crates and tools relevant to Yew.
    - **Frameworks**
      - Higher-level frameworks or meta-frameworks built around Yew.

- **Tooling**
  - Tools that help build, optimize, and manage Yew/WebAssembly projects, including:
    - `wasm-pack`
    - `wasm-bindgen`
    - `Trunk`
    - `wasm-strip`
    - `wasm-objdump`
    - `wasm-opt`
    - `rustfmt`

- **Articles**
  - Written guides, blog posts, and technical articles covering Yew and related topics.

- **Courses**
  - Structured online courses and tutorials for learning Yew and WebAssembly.

- **Books**
  - Longer-form learning resources and books, including topics such as:
    - *Advanced JavaScript Integration with Yew*
    - *Creating a Client-Side WebAssembly App Using Yew*

- **Alternatives**
  - Links to alternative or related frameworks and projects in the Rust/WebAssembly ecosystem.
  - Emphasizes cross-project idea-sharing in the WebAssembly frontend space.

- **Related Lists**
  - Other “awesome” or curated lists that are relevant to Yew, Rust, or WebAssembly development.
