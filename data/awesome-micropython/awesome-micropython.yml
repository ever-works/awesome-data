  ## Overview


  Awesome MicroPython is an open, community-maintained "awesome list" that
  aggregates high-quality MicroPython-related projects and references. It
  focuses on tools and code that run on microcontrollers using MicroPython,
  covering a broad ecosystem around embedded Python and IoT development.


  MicroPython itself is a lean and efficient implementation of Python 3,
  including a small subset of the standard library and optimized for constrained
  hardware.

  ## Features


  - **Curated Awesome List**  
    - Focused specifically on MicroPython and its ecosystem.  
    - Follows the general "awesome" list conventions (quality, organization, discoverability).

  - **MicroPython Libraries Directory**  
    - Organized collection of third‑party libraries for MicroPython.  
    - Multiple topical sections (as indicated by headings), including for example:  
      - AI-related libraries (e.g., basic ML/AI tooling suited to microcontrollers).  
      - Audio-related libraries (e.g., sound generation, playback, or DSP on MicroPython boards).  
      - Communications libraries (e.g., networking, serial, wireless modules).  
    - Notes on other places to look for MicroPython libraries, including use of `pip install` where applicable.

  - **Frameworks and Software**  
    - Links to higher‑level frameworks built on MicroPython.  
    - References to tools, utilities, and applications that support development and deployment of MicroPython code.

  - **Learning & Reference Resources**  
    - Documentation and guides related to MicroPython usage.  
    - External resources (blogs, docs sites, etc.) that help learn or deepen knowledge of MicroPython and embedded Python.

  - **Repository & Documentation Structure**  
    - `docs/` directory and `mkdocs.yml` for a browsable documentation site.  
    - `contributing.md` outlining how to propose additions or changes to the list.  
    - Standard project files such as `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and `requirements.txt`.

  - **Web Presence**  
    - Linked standalone site at **https://awesome-micropython.com/** backed by the GitHub repository contents.  
    - Uses a custom theme (`custom_theme/`) and static assets (e.g., logo) for readable navigation of the list.

  - **Open Source & Community Contributions**  
    - Public GitHub repository (`mcauser/awesome-micropython`) with full history and over 1,000 commits.  
    - Workflow definitions under `.github/workflows/` for automated checks or site publishing.
