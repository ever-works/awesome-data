  # Awesome Tor


  **Website:** https://github.com/polycarbohydrate/awesome-tor#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Brand:** Tor  

  **Tags:** awesome-lists, security, privacy


  ## Overview

  Awesome Tor is an "awesome-style" curated directory of tools, libraries,
  documentation, and other resources for working with or learning about the Tor
  anonymous communication network. It aggregates community-maintained links
  rather than providing software or a service itself.


  The list is independently produced and is not an official Tor Project product.


  ## What is Tor?

  Tor is a free, open-source overlay network designed to enable anonymous
  communication. It routes user traffic through a random path of more than seven
  thousand volunteer-run relays worldwide to help conceal user identity and
  location.


  ## Features

  - **Curated resource list:** Collects links to tools, applications, libraries,
  documentation, and learning materials related to the Tor network.

  - **Awesome-list format:** Follows the community "Awesome" list conventions
  (categorized, link-based, GitHub-hosted directory).

  - **Tor-focused scope:** Concentrates specifically on the Tor
  ecosystem—software, infrastructure, and educational content for anonymity and
  privacy.

  - **Open-source repository:** Hosted on GitHub, with version history and
  public commits.

  - **Contribution guidelines:** Includes `contributing.md` describing how users
  can propose additions or changes to the list.

  - **Code of conduct:** Provides `code-of-conduct.md` to set expectations for
  participant behavior in the project.

  - **Supplementary documentation:** Contains additional markdown documents such
  as `selfhost-snowflake.md`, indicating guidance or resources for running
  Tor-related components (e.g., Snowflake bridges) yourself.

  - **License file:** Includes a `LICENSE` file specifying terms under which the
  list’s content can be reused.


  ## Notes / Disclaimers

  - The list is independent from the official Tor Project and comes with no
  guarantees from the Tor Project regarding quality or suitability of listed
  resources.


  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. This is an open, GitHub-hosted curated list of links, not a
  commercial product or service.
