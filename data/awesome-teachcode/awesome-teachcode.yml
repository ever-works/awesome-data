      - Example usage in course tracking spreadsheets, assuming a `username/reponame` format in a cell (e.g., `C2`) that links to GitHub repositories.

  - **Documentation Structure for the Directory**
    - `_navbar.md` and `_sidebar.md` to organize navigation when browsing the list as a documentation site (e.g., via Docsify or static hosting).

  - **Assets and Configuration**
    - `assets/` directory (for images or supplementary files used in the documentation/site).
    - `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing, allowing custom static-site behavior.
