  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Web is a curated meta-index within the broader Meta Awesome
  project that aggregates multiple “awesome” lists focused on web technologies.
  It serves as a central directory pointing to independently maintained
  collections covering various areas of web development and the web ecosystem.


  ## Features

  - **Meta index for web-related awesome lists**  
    Aggregates links to numerous awesome lists that cover web technologies in general, providing a single entry point instead of searching for each list individually.

  - **Broad coverage of web technologies**  
    Focuses on the web domain as a whole, potentially including (depending on the linked lists):
    - Frontend frameworks and libraries
    - Backend and server-side technologies for the web
    - Web standards, APIs, and protocols
    - Tooling and workflows for web development
    - Performance, security, and accessibility resources

  - **Part of the Meta Awesome project**  
    Integrated into the larger Meta Awesome structure, which organizes many topic-specific meta-indexes. The `web.md` document is specifically dedicated to web-related content.

  - **Git-based, community-editable directory**  
    Hosted on GitHub, so additions and updates can be proposed via pull requests, allowing the directory to evolve along with the web ecosystem.

  - **Structured documentation format**  
    The content is maintained as a markdown document (`doc/web.md`), making it easy to read, diff, and consume both on GitHub and in other markdown-compatible environments.

  ## Data Source & Maintenance

  suggest new awesome lists or improvements.
