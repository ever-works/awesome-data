  # Awesome Audit Algorithms


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Slug:** awesome-audit-algorithms  

  **Owner / Brand:** erwanlemerrer  

  **Source:** <https://github.com/erwanlemerrer/awesome-audit-algorithms#readme>


  ## Overview


  Awesome Audit Algorithms is a curated GitHub list of algorithms, methods, and
  academic papers dedicated to auditing black-box algorithms. It focuses on
  techniques for gaining insight into remote algorithms (e.g., via APIs) used
  for recommendation, scoring, and classification, particularly for fairness,
  transparency, and accountability.


  ## Features


  - **Curated Awesome List**
    - Organized collection of resources specifically on algorithmic auditing.
    - Follows the “Awesome” list format and conventions.

  - **Focus on Black-Box Audits**
    - Targets scenarios where algorithms are operated by third-party providers.
    - Assumes auditors have no internal access to model parameters or training data.
    - Emphasizes querying remote algorithms through available interfaces (e.g., APIs) to infer behavior.

  - **Algorithms for Auditing**
    - Lists algorithms designed to:
      - Probe and test recommendation systems.
      - Audit scoring and ranking systems.
      - Investigate classification models.
    - Methods aim to infer properties such as bias, robustness, and behavior under different inputs.

  - **Research Papers by Year**
    - Papers section organized chronologically, including (where populated in the repo):
      - 2005, 2008
      - 2012–2015
      - 2016–2025
    - Facilitates historical tracing of developments in algorithmic auditing.

  - **Related Events**
    - Section for **Related Events** with entries organized by year (2023–2025), intended to track workshops, conferences, and other academic/industry events on algorithm auditing.

  - **Topics & Resources Sections**
    - **Topics**: Thematic grouping of materials (e.g., fairness, transparency, auditing methods) as defined in the repository.
    - **Resources**: Additional materials stored under a `resources` directory (such as images, figures, or supplementary documents for understanding audit setups).

  - **Governance and Community Docs**
    - **Code of Conduct**: Defines expected behavior for contributors and participants.
    - **Contributing Guidelines**: Instructions for proposing additions and updates to the list.
    - **License**: Specifies the reuse terms for the list content.

  ## Use Cases


  - Discover algorithms and methods for auditing third-party, black-box AI
  systems.

  - Find academic references and research papers on fairness and transparency
  audits.

  - Explore historical and current work on auditing recommendation, scoring, and
  classification models.

  - Track related events in the algorithmic auditing research community.
