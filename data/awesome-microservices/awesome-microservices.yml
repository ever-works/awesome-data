  ## Overview

  Awesome Microservices is a curated directory of resources, tools, and
  technologies related to microservice architecture. It organizes platforms,
  frameworks, toolkits, and reference materials to help design, build, operate,
  and document microservices-based systems.


  ## Features


  ### Scope & Organization
