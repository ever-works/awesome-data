**Category:** Meta-directories  
**Slug:** `meta-awesome-websites`  
**Source:** <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/websites.md>

## Overview
Meta Awesome – Websites is part of the Meta Awesome collection. It is a meta-directory that aggregates curated lists ("awesome" lists) specifically focused on useful, interesting, or specialized websites. Instead of listing individual sites directly, it points to high-quality, maintained lists across many topics.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of lists**
  - Aggregates multiple curated "awesome" lists that focus on websites.
  - Serves as a hub to discover other well-maintained collections rather than duplicating their content.

- **Thematic organization**
  - Lists are grouped by subject or niche (e.g., tools, learning resources, entertainment, professional utilities), depending on what the underlying awesome lists cover.
  - Helps users quickly find collections aligned with a specific area of interest.

- **Curation-focused**
  - Emphasizes lists that are curated (typically open-source lists maintained on GitHub).
  - Prioritizes useful, interesting, or specialized websites rather than general link dumps.

- **Part of the Meta Awesome ecosystem**
  - Integrates with other Meta Awesome documents (e.g., meta-lists for books, tools, data, etc.).
  - Uses consistent formatting and structure familiar to users of the Awesome and Meta Awesome projects.

- **GitHub-based maintenance**
  - Hosted as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository.
  - Can be updated, extended, and improved via pull requests and issues in the repo.

- **Link-centric navigation**
  - Each entry typically links out to another list (often a GitHub `awesome-*` repository or similar curated resource).
  - Acts as a starting point for deeper exploration of specific website collections.

## Use Cases
- Finding curated collections of websites for learning, research, or hobby interests.
- Discovering niche or specialized website lists without searching for each one individually.
- Using it as a reference index when building or updating your own awesome-style list.

## Pricing
- Not a commercial product or service.
- Publicly accessible GitHub document; usage is free.
