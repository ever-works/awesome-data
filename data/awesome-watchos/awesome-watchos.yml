  ## Features


  ### Scope of the List

  - Focused specifically on **watchOS** development for Apple Watch.

  - Curated links to:
    - Development **frameworks and libraries**
    - **Sample apps**
    - **Design guidelines** and resources
    - **Tools** for prototyping and asset generation

  ### Main Sections


  #### 1. Getting Started

  - Introductory resources to begin **watchOS app development** (high-level
  category; concrete links not visible in provided content).


  #### 2. Libraries and Frameworks

  - Organized by use case, including (but not limited to):

    **Connectivity**
    - Libraries focused on communication between Apple Watch and iPhone apps (e.g., frameworks similar to MMWormhole, as illustrated in the repo).

    **UI Components**
    - User interface helpers and components tailored to watchOS, including:
      - Table-like interfaces for Watch apps (e.g., IGInterfaceDataTable-style components).
      - Activity / progress indicator UIs customized for the watch form factor.

    **Charts and Data Visualization**
    - Charting/image-kit style libraries for visualizing data on Apple Watch screens (e.g., YOChartImageKit-type resources):
      - Full-screen chart collections
      - Small, glance-style chart images

  #### 3. Design

    **Design Guidelines**
    - Links to official or well-regarded guidelines for **designing for watchOS**, such as:
      - Layout and typography best practices for small screens
      - Interaction and navigation patterns suitable for Apple Watch

    **Design Resources**
    - Asset packs, templates, and other design-oriented materials to help create watchOS interfaces and visuals.

  #### 4. Tools

    **Prototyping Tools**
    - Tools or services useful for **rapidly prototyping watchOS interfaces and interactions** before full implementation.

    **Image / Asset Generators**
    - Utilities for generating watchOS-specific **image assets** (e.g., resizing, slicing, or automating multiple watch-size exports).

  #### 5. Sample Apps

  - Curated examples of **real watchOS sample applications**, including:
    - **Lister** (Apple’s sample app from the iOS/watchOS developer library), showcasing:
      - Best practices for data handling between iOS and watchOS
      - Common UI and UX patterns on Apple Watch

  #### 6. Contribution Guidelines (Repository-Level)

  ## Additional Notes


  - The repository explicitly states it is **deprecated** and **will no longer
