  # Scalable CSS Reading List


  A curated collection of articles, talks, and resources focused on defining and
  practicing **scalable, maintainable CSS architectures**.


  ---


  ## Overview


  **Scalable CSS Reading List** is a GitHub-hosted, curated list that collects
  what the author considers the most important resources for understanding:


  - *What is scalable CSS?*

  - *How do we create scalable CSS?*


  The list focuses specifically on CSS architecture and scalability, not on
  general CSS syntax, specific properties, or unrelated topics like performance
  or responsive design.

  ## Features


  ### Purpose & Scope

  - Concentrates on **scalable, maintainable CSS**, rather than general CSS
  learning.

  - Aims to highlight **key principles and practices** for writing CSS that
  scales in larger projects.

  - Includes only resources the curator considers **most important** or best at
  explaining different approaches to scalable CSS.

  - Explicitly **excludes** broader CSS topics such as:
    - Basic CSS concepts
    - Using specific properties
    - Achieving particular visual effects
    - Responsive design techniques
    - General performance optimization

  ### Content Types

  - **Articles**
    - Primary focus of the list
    - Ordered from newest to oldest
    - Address theories, methods, and patterns for scalable CSS.

  - **Authoring Frameworks & Longer Readings**
    - In-depth discussions of CSS authoring methodologies and architectural approaches.
    - Longer-form content (e.g., guides, extensive blog series, or documentation-style posts).

  - **CSS Styleguides**
    - Collections of conventions and guidelines for **authoring** scalable CSS.
    - Concentrate on naming, structure, and rules that help keep CSS maintainable.
    - Explicitly distinguished from **pattern libraries**:
      - Styleguides: how to write styles going forward.
      - Pattern libraries: document and exemplify existing styles.

  - **Workflow Overviews**
    - “How we do CSS at [company/team] …” style write-ups.
    - Describe **real-world CSS methodologies** used in production for sites and apps at scale.
    - Emphasize practical workflows, team processes, and architectural decisions.
    - Generally do not introduce new principles beyond other sections, but valued for their **pragmatic, concrete examples**.

  - **Talks**
    - Curated list of conference talks and presentations about scalable CSS.
    - Ordered (roughly) from newest to oldest.

  ### Organization & Curation

  - Sections do **not** imply ranking or priority.

  - There is **no suggested reading order**; readers are encouraged to “read
  them all.”

  - New resources are added as they are discovered and deemed high quality.


  ### Contribution & Community

  - Open to contributions via **issues and pull requests** on GitHub.

  - Invitation for users to suggest additional high-quality resources related to
