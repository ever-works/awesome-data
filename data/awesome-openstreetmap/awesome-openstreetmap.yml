  # Awesome OpenStreetMap


  **Brand:** OpenStreetMap  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** GIS, maps, awesome-lists


  ## Overview

  Awesome OpenStreetMap is a curated, community-maintained list of tools,
  editors, libraries, and other resources built on or for the OpenStreetMap
  (OSM) ecosystem. It focuses on both:

  - Projects that use OSM data in creative or practical ways, and

  - Projects dedicated to improving the OSM map itself.


  The list is hosted as a public GitHub repository and is freely accessible.


  ## Features


  ### Scope and Structure

  - **Curated project directory** centered on OpenStreetMap-related software and
  resources.

  - **Focus on both usage and improvement of OSM**:
    - Applications and services that consume OSM data.
    - Tools that help edit, maintain, or otherwise enhance OSM.
  - **Organized by category** for easier discovery of relevant tools and
  projects.


  ### Main Categories

  - **Editors**
    - *Web Editors*: Browser-based editors for modifying OpenStreetMap data.
    - *Mobile Editors*: Smartphone or tablet apps for editing OSM on the go.
    - *Native Editors*: Desktop or native applications for editing OSM data.

  - **Tools**
    - *Web Tools*: Online utilities and services that work with OSM data (e.g., validation, visualization, analysis). Includes entries like `opening_hours` tools.
    - *Mobile Tools*: Mobile applications that assist with mapping, data collection, or other OSM-related tasks.
    - *Native Tools*: Installable desktop tools for processing or managing OSM data.
    - *Browser Extensions*: Extensions that integrate OSM-related capabilities into web browsers.

  - **Changeset Tools**
    - *Web Services*: Online services for inspecting, analyzing, or managing OSM changesets.

  - **Tasking Managers**
    - Websites that divide mapping work into small, assignable tasks.
    - Designed to coordinate groups of contributors towards shared mapping goals.
    - Recommended starting point for newcomers who want to help improve OSM.

  - **Maps**
    - *Web Maps*: Web-based map viewers and applications using OSM.
    - *Mobile Maps*: Mobile apps centered on OSM-based navigation or viewing.
    - *Generators*: Tools that render or export map tiles, images, or other map outputs from OSM data.
    - *Map Styles*: Style definitions and resources for customizing the visual appearance of OSM-based maps.
    - *Map Games*: Games built around OSM data or mapping tasks.
    - *Goal Tracking*: Services that track personal or fitness goals using OSM-based mapping data.

  - **Libraries**
    - *C/C++*: Libraries for handling or processing OSM data in C/C++.
    - *JavaScript*: JS libraries and frameworks for web mapping, visualization, or OSM data interaction.
    - *Python*: Python libraries for accessing, analyzing, or transforming OSM data.

  ### Maintenance and Community

  - **Unmaintained Projects List**
    - A separate document (`UNMAINTAINED.md`) lists projects that are no longer actively maintained.
    - Intended to help developers discover abandoned-but-useful projects they may want to adopt.

  - **Contribution Guidelines**
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` describes how to propose additions or updates to the list.

  - **Code of Conduct**
    - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` defines expected behavior for contributors and participants.

  - **Open Licensing**
    - The repository includes a `LICENSE` file, indicating the list is shared under an open license (exact terms in the file).

  ## Pricing

  - The Awesome OpenStreetMap list is a public, open GitHub repository.  

  - **Access and use are free of charge.** There are no pricing plans or paid
  tiers described.
