## Overview
Awesome Django (best-of-django) is a curated, ranked directory of open‑source Django-related Python projects. It aggregates Django apps, tools, starter projects, and learning resources, organizing them into categories and ranking them based on an automated project-quality score derived from GitHub and package manager metrics.

## Features

### Curated Django Ecosystem Directory
- Contains ~300 open‑source Django-related projects.  
- Projects are grouped into ~74 topical categories, including (examples from navigation):
  - Admin Interface
  - Admin Interface Actions
  - Admin Interface Filters
  - Management Commands
  - Caching
  - Configuration
  - (And many more Django-related categories across the ecosystem.)
- Focuses on Django apps, starter templates, utilities, and learning resources.

### Ranking & Quality Metrics
- Each project is assigned a *project-quality score*.
- Scores are computed automatically from:
  - GitHub metrics (e.g., stars, activity, etc.).
  - Data from various package managers (where applicable).
- List is ordered by this quality score, providing a ranked view of the ecosystem.

### Regular Updates
- The list is updated weekly to reflect:
  - New projects.
  - Changes in project quality metrics.
  - Repository activity over time.

### Open Contribution Workflow
- Community-driven curation model.
- Multiple contribution pathways:
  - Open an issue to propose additions or changes.
  - Submit a pull request with edits or new entries.
  - Directly edit the `projects.yaml` file (the source for the list) via GitHub.
- Clear contribution documentation via `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
