  ## Overview


  Awesome OpenGL is a GitHub-hosted collection that organizes high-quality
  OpenGL-related resources into clear sections. It focuses on libraries,
  debuggers, editors, and educational material (articles, books, talks, and
  more) for developers working with modern OpenGL and GLSL.

  ## Features


  ### Structured Resource Categories

  - **Articles**
    - Hand-picked OpenGL articles (explicitly non-tutorials), including deep dives and opinion pieces.
    - Example entry: Ray tracing with OpenGL compute shaders (multi-part series using LWJGL).
    - Includes discussions of OpenGL design and pain points (e.g., “Things that drive me nuts about OpenGL”).

  - **Books**
    - Curated list of OpenGL and graphics programming books (titles listed in full README).

  - **Debug**
    - Tools and debuggers for diagnosing and inspecting OpenGL applications.

  - **GLSL Editors**
    - Editors and tools specialized for authoring and testing GLSL shaders.

  - **Libraries**
    - OpenGL-related libraries and frameworks, including C/C++-oriented options and likely multi-language bindings.

  - **Profile Loaders**
    - Utilities that simplify loading OpenGL function pointers / extensions for different profiles.

  - **References**
    - Official and community reference documentation for OpenGL APIs and GLSL.

  - **Talks**
    - Conference talks and presentations on OpenGL techniques, best practices, and architecture.

  - **Videos**
    - Recorded lectures and video series for visual learning of OpenGL concepts.

  - **Websites**
    - External sites and portals focused on OpenGL and real-time graphics.

  ### Curation & Community

  - Curated to meet the standards of the broader **Awesome** list ecosystem.

  - Public GitHub repository structure with:
    - `README.md` as the main index of resources.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing how to propose additions and changes.
  - Open to community contributions via pull requests.


  ### Technology Focus

  - Emphasis on **OpenGL** for 2D and 3D graphics programming.

  - Includes **GLSL**-related tools and resources.

  - Many items oriented toward **C/C++** usage (as reflected in tags and typical
  OpenGL ecosystems), as well as bindings through libraries like LWJGL.

  ## Pricing


  - **Free**: The list and all repository contents are freely accessible as an
  open-source GitHub repository (individual linked resources may have their own
  licenses or pricing).
