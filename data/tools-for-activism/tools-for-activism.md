## Overview

Tools for Activism is an "Awesome"-style, curated directory of digital tools and resources for activism, campaigning, organizing, and communication for social change. It aggregates both self-hosted open-source projects and software-as-a-service tools relevant to individuals, ad-hoc groups, and formal organizations.

## Features

- **Curated list format**
  - Hand-picked collection of "awesome" digital tools focused specifically on activism and organizing.
  - Designed for individuals, grassroots groups, and established organizations working on social change.

- **Covers multiple tool types**
  - **Open-source, host-it-yourself tools**
    - Includes projects that can be self-hosted, generally requiring some technical setup and server hosting.
  - **Software-as-a-service tools**
    - Includes tools accessible directly via a web browser without self-hosting.
  - **Operating systems**
    - Section dedicated to operating systems relevant to secure or activism-related use cases (listed category, details not shown in excerpt).
  - **Browsers**
    - Focus on privacy-, security-, and censorship-resistance-oriented browsers:
      - **Tor Browser** – Free software for anonymous communication:
        - Prevents observers of your internet connection from seeing which sites you visit.
        - Prevents visited sites from learning your physical location.
        - Enables access to sites blocked by censorship.
      - **Brave Browser** – Free and open-source browser based on Chromium:
        - Blocks ads and website trackers by default.
        - Provides a mechanism for users to send contributions (via Basic Attention Tokens) to websites and content creators.

- **Project status categories**
  - **Active tools list**
    - Main list of tools currently usable for activism and organizing.
  - **Projects to keep an eye on**
    - Highlights in-development projects that are not finished but are notable and potentially useful in the near future.
  - **The Graveyard**
    - Records tools or projects that previously existed but are no longer maintained or available, helping users avoid dead ends and understand historical context.

- **Contribution workflow**
  - Open for community contributions via GitHub.
  - Contributions are suggested and discussed through GitHub Issues (and likely pull requests, implied by standard Awesome list practice).

## Content Structure

- Table of Contents for quickly navigating list sections.
- Sections divided by type of tool (self-hosted, SaaS, OS, browsers, etc.).
