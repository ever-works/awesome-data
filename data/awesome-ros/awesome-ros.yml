  ## Overview

  Awesome ROS is a curated directory of libraries, tools, and learning resources for **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**. It aggregates community-maintained links to packages and documentation used to build modern robot applications, from low-level drivers to high-level algorithms.

  The list is hosted as an open-source GitHub repository and is being handed over to the **Open Robotics / ROS 2** GitHub organization.

  ## Features

  - **Curated ROS 2 resource collection**  
    - Focused specifically on **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2) rather than ROS 1.  
    - Includes links to libraries, tools, and reference material used in robotics projects.

  - **ROS 2 package categories** (examples visible from the content):  
    - **Data collection** – ROS 2 packages and tools for gathering, logging, and handling robotics data.  
      - Illustrated by `ros2_data_collection` entry.  
    - **Demonstrations** – Example robots, demos, and reference projects that showcase ROS 2 in action.  
      - Includes items like `adlink_ddsbot`, `adlink_neuronbot`, and other demo platforms.

  - **Repository structure & community docs**  
    - `readme.md` – Main awesome list with categorized links and descriptions.  
    - `LICENSE.md` – Licensing information for reuse of the list.  
    - `code-of-conduct.md` – Community behavior guidelines for contributors.  
    - `contributing.md` – Instructions and standards for adding new entries or improving existing ones.  
    - `.travis.yml` – Continuous integration configuration (used to validate or lint the list).  
    - `_config.yml` – Configuration for rendering the list (e.g., GitHub Pages/Jekyll).  
    - `ros_logo.svg` – ROS logo assets included in the repository.

  - **Open source and community-driven**  
    - Public GitHub repository that accepts contributions via pull requests.  
    - Follows the **Awesome List** conventions and uses the official “Awesome” badge.  
    - In the process of being migrated to the official **ROS 2 GitHub organization**, aligning it with the broader ROS ecosystem.

  - **General ROS 2 context and positioning**  
    - Emphasizes ROS 2 as a **set of software libraries and tools** for building robot applications.  
    - Covers components ranging from **drivers** to **state-of-the-art algorithms** and **developer tools**.  
    - All referenced ROS 2 software is **open source**.

  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. Awesome ROS is an open-source, community-maintained directory of links hosted on GitHub and is free to access and use.
