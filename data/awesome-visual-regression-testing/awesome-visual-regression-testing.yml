  ## Overview

  Awesome Visual Regression Testing is a curated GitHub list of tools, services,
  and learning resources focused on visual regression testing. It helps
  developers, QA engineers, and designers find ways to ensure that UI and style
  changes do not unintentionally alter existing behavior or appearance.


  ## Features

  - **Curated resource collection**
    - Focused specifically on visual regression testing.
    - Covers multiple roles and perspectives (Developer, QA, UX/Design).
    - Aims at regression testing activities after code has been written.

  - **Structured contents** (as outlined in the README)
    - **General information**: Introductory and conceptual resources about visual regression testing.
    - **Browser automation**: Tools and libraries related to automating browsers, often used as a basis for visual checks.
    - **Tools and frameworks (A–Z)**: A collection of self-hosted or installable tools and frameworks for visual regression testing.
    - **Online services (A–Z)**: Hosted / SaaS-style services that provide visual regression testing capabilities.
    - **Blog posts (A–Z)**: Articles and write-ups on techniques, workflows, and case studies.
    - **Slideshows, talks and videos (A–Z)**: Conference talks, presentations, and video content.
    - **Deprecated tools**: Section for projects that are no longer actively maintained but may still be informative due to existing usage.
    - **Miscellaneous**: Additional items that don’t fit neatly into other sections.

  - **Project governance and community**
    - **Contribution guide**: Clear instructions on how to add or update resources in the list.
    - **Code of Conduct**: Defines expected behavior to maintain an open and welcoming community.
    - Hosted as a public GitHub repository with issue and PR workflows.

  ## Use Cases

  - Discovering tools and frameworks for implementing visual regression tests in
  frontend projects.

  - Comparing available online services for automated visual UI checks.

  - Learning best practices and techniques via blogs, talks, and videos.

  - Exploring historical and deprecated tools for context or migration
  decisions.


  ## Pricing

  - The list itself is **free and open-source**.  

  - It is a GitHub repository available at no cost under its included license.


  ## Additional Notes

  - The list is explicitly described as *incomplete*, encouraging ongoing
  community contributions to keep it updated and relevant.

  - It complements broader software testing lists (e.g., `awesome-testing`) by
  specializing in visual regression testing.
