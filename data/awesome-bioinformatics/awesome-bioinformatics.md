## Overview

Awesome Bioinformatics is a curated, community-maintained directory of bioinformatics software, libraries, data resources, and educational materials. It focuses primarily on free and open-source, command-line–oriented tools used for analyzing and understanding biological data.

## Features

- **Curated awesome list format**
  - Follows the Awesome List conventions (from the sindresorhus/awesome ecosystem).
  - Emphasizes high-quality, widely used, and well-documented resources.

- **Focus on bioinformatics software and libraries**
  - Highlights tools for biological data analysis across genomics and related life-science domains.
  - Prioritizes command-line and programmatic tools suited to research workflows.

- **Package suites section**
  - Dedicated section for language- or platform-specific package ecosystems used in bioinformatics, including for example:
    - **Bioperl** – Perl-based open-source tools for bioinformatics, genomics, and life sciences.
    - **Bioconductor** – Large ecosystem (1500+ packages) for analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data.
    - **Biopython** – Python tools for biological computing, with a cookbook, packaging, and extensive documentation.

- **Broad resource types**
  - Software packages and libraries.
  - Command-line tools.
  - Data resources and reference materials.
  - Educational and learning resources (e.g., tutorials, documentation links, key papers where provided).

- **Open-source emphasis**
  - Primarily lists free and/or open-source projects.
  - Includes links to source repositories, project websites, and foundational publications when available.

- **Contribution-friendly**
  - Public contribution guidelines available via `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Community contributions used to expand and maintain the list.

- **Automated maintenance helpers**
  - **URL checking workflow** – GitHub Actions workflow to automatically check external links for validity.
  - **TOC generation workflow** – GitHub Actions workflow to generate and maintain a table of contents for the main README.

- **Structured navigation**
  - Table of contents grouping resources into logical sections (e.g., package suites; additional categories present in the full README beyond the provided excerpt).

## Pricing

- Not applicable. Awesome Bioinformatics is a free, open-source directory of links and resources.
