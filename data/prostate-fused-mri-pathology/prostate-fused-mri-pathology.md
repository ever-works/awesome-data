## Overview
Prostate-Fused-MRI-Pathology is a curated prostate cancer imaging dataset entry within an “Awesome Public Datasets”–style directory. It highlights resources where prostate MRI data are spatially aligned (fused) with pathology, enabling research and benchmarking in computer vision, medical imaging, and clinical data analysis.

Because the source page is a generic directory listing and does not expose detailed technical documentation, only high-level information is available.

## Features
- **Curated listing:** Part of a broader “Data Science Public Datasets” / “Awesome Public Datasets” directory focused on research-ready resources.
- **Domain focus:** Prostate cancer, with emphasis on combining imaging and pathology data.
- **Modality:** MRI imaging of the prostate, paired with pathology information.
- **Fused data:** Imaging and pathology are aligned/registered to each other to support pixel/voxel-level or region-level analysis.
- **Use cases:** Intended for research and benchmarking in prostate cancer detection, segmentation, diagnosis support, and related machine learning tasks.
- **Public dataset orientation:** Cataloged as a public or open research dataset suitable for data science applications.

## Intended Use Cases
- Development and evaluation of prostate cancer detection algorithms from MRI.
- Image–pathology correlation studies.
- Benchmarking segmentation or classification models in medical imaging.
- Educational use in data science and medical imaging courses.

## Access
The item is referenced within a Scribd document listing data science public datasets. The Scribd page itself does not provide direct download links or access instructions; additional steps (e.g., following links in the full document or searching by dataset name) may be required to obtain the actual data.

## Pricing
The directory entry does not specify any pricing or licensing details for the Prostate-Fused-MRI-Pathology dataset. Terms of access (e.g., open access, registration, or institutional approval) are not described in the available content and would need to be confirmed via the dataset’s primary host or publication.
