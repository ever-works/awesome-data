  ## Overview

  Awesome WebExtensions is a curated directory of resources for developing
  cross‑browser WebExtensions (browser extensions). It aggregates learning
  materials, libraries, tools, boilerplates, and example projects to help
  developers build extensions that work across major browsers.


  WebExtensions are a cross‑browser system for building add‑ons. The APIs are
  largely compatible with the extension APIs used by Google Chrome, and most
  Chrome extensions can run in Firefox with minor changes.


  ## Features

  - **Curated, categorized resource list**
    - Organized contents to help you navigate different aspects of WebExtensions development.
    - Focused specifically on cross‑browser browser‑extension development.

  - **Getting Started resources**
    - Guides and introductory materials for developers new to WebExtensions.

  - **Community references**
    - Pointers to relevant communities and channels, including:
      - `#addons:mozilla.org`
      - `google-chrome-extension`
      - `firefox-addon-webextensions`
      - `microsoft-edge-extension`

  - **Libraries and Frameworks**
    - Code libraries intended to be used within WebExtensions (e.g., in `content_scripts` or via `browser` APIs).
    - Focus on reusable components that become part of the extension codebase.

  - **Tools**
    - Applications and utilities that help manage, build, or handle metadata for extensions.
    - Includes resources related to `manifest.json` and other extension configuration aspects.

  - **Testing resources**
    - References for testing WebExtensions, such as frameworks, tools, or guides to validate extension behavior across browsers.

  - **Boilerplates**
    - Ready‑to‑use starter templates for WebExtensions projects.
    - Designed to give a modern project structure with sensible defaults.

  - **Sample Extensions**
    - Simple, modern example repositories demonstrating real extension structures.
    - Include examples of automatic deployment setups (e.g., via Travis CI) to show end‑to‑end workflows.

  - **Contribution guidelines**
    - A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file describing how to propose additions or changes to the list.

  - **Open licensing**
    - A `LICENSE` file defines the open source terms for using and contributing to the list.

  ## Pricing
