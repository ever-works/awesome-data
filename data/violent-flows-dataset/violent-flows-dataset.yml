  # Violent-Flows Dataset


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Type:** Research video dataset (crowd violence / non-violence)  

  **Source:** http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/data/violentflows/


  ---


  ## Overview

  The Violent-Flows dataset is a collection of real-world crowd violence and
  non-violence video clips designed as a benchmark for violence detection
  research. It supports:

  - Violent vs. non-violent video classification

  - Violence outbreak detection in crowds


  The dataset is commonly used in computer vision and video analysis research,
  particularly for behavior and anomaly detection in crowds.
