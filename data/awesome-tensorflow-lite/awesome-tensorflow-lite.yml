  ## Features


  ### Curated TensorFlow Lite Resources

  - **TensorFlow Lite models collection**
    - A broad list of TensorFlow Lite models.
    - Includes links to pretrained `.tflite` models (e.g., MobileNet variants).
    - References to models available from the TensorFlow Lite model zoo.
    - Includes MediaPipe-based pretrained models that can be used with or without MediaPipe.

  - **Models with sample implementations**
    - Models paired with:
      - Sample Android and other platform apps.
      - Device-specific implementations and code examples.
      - Reference documentation or blog posts.
    - Organized by task; for example, within Computer Vision:
      - **Classification** (e.g., MobileNetV1 with downloadable quantized model and labels, plus Android app sample and source code links).

  - **Tooling and optimization resources** (inferred from TensorFlow Lite focus)
    - Guidance and tools for:
      - Converting TensorFlow 2.x / Keras models to TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`).
      - Optimizing models for mobile and edge (e.g., quantization, size/performance tradeoffs).
      - Deploying to mobile and edge devices at scale.

  - **Tutorials and learning materials**
    - Links to tutorials for:
      - Training TensorFlow models with tf.keras.
      - Converting to TensorFlow Lite.
      - Integrating models into mobile apps.
    - Additional learning resources about on-device and mobile ML.
