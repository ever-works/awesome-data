# Awesome Streaming

A curated, GitHub-hosted directory of streaming (stream processing) frameworks, applications, libraries, and related resources, organized in an “awesome list” format.

## Overview

- **Type:** Open-source curated directory / awesome list
- **Focus:** Streaming and stream processing technologies and resources
- **Maintainer/Brand:** manuzhang
- **Source:** https://github.com/manuzhang/awesome-streaming
- **Website (dynamic view):** https://manuzhang.github.io/awesome-streaming/

## Features

### Core Purpose
- Curated list of **streaming (stream processing)** tools and resources.
- Focus on **big data streaming**, near-real-time processing, and related ecosystems.
- Inspired by the broader **awesome-* style** lists (structured, community-driven curation).

### Organization & Structure
- Uses a categorized **Table of Contents** to organize entries:
  - **Streaming Engine** – Core distributed streaming/stream+batch engines and compute platforms.
  - **Streaming Library** – Libraries and SDKs for building streaming applications.
  - **Streaming Application** – End-user or higher-level applications built on top of streaming engines.
  - **IoT** – Streaming-related tools and frameworks targeted at Internet of Things scenarios.
  - **DSL** – Domain-specific languages for defining streaming jobs or pipelines.
  - **Data Pipeline** – Tools for building and managing data pipelines around streaming systems.
  - **Online Machine Learning** – Resources and tools for applying ML models in online/streaming contexts.
  - **Streaming SQL** – SQL engines and extensions for querying streaming data.
  - **Toolkit** – Utilities, helper tools, and supporting software for streaming workflows.
  - **Benchmark** – Benchmarking suites and projects for evaluating streaming systems.
  - **Closed Source** – Non-open-source streaming products and services (documented for reference).
  - **Readings** – Articles, papers, and educational resources on stream processing.

### Content Characteristics
- Each entry typically includes:
  - **Project name**
  - **Repository or homepage URL**
  - **Language tag** (e.g., `[Java]`, `[Rust]`) where applicable
  - **One-line description** summarizing purpose or key capability
- Covers a wide range of **ecosystem components**:
  - Unified stream + batch processing
  - Distributed compute platforms (often Arrow-based or big-data focused)
  - Data pipelines and ingestion layers
  - Higher-level applications and frameworks around streaming engines

### Dynamic Website
- Provides a separate **dynamic website** (https://manuzhang.github.io/awesome-streaming/) that:
  - Mirrors the GitHub list content
  - Surfaces **updates** to the awesome projects listed
  - Offers a more navigable view compared to raw Markdown in the repository

### Community & Maintenance
- Hosted on GitHub with:
  - Public repository
  - Contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) for community submissions and updates
  - Issues and pull requests available for enhancements and corrections

## Pricing

- **Free**: This is an open-source, public GitHub repository and website. Access, browsing, and contributions are free of charge; no pricing plans or paid tiers are provided.
