  - **Category:** Themed directories  

  - **Tags:** GIS, web, data-visualization  

  - **Maintainer / Brand:** joewdavies


  ## Overview

  Awesome Frontend GIS is an "awesome list"–style directory that compiles
  geospatial-related frontend resources. It focuses on everything needed to
  manage, analyze, edit, and visualize geographic data directly in the browser,
  from JavaScript libraries to data sources, demos, tutorials, and further
  reading.


  ## Features


  ### 1. Curated JavaScript Libraries

  A structured list of JS tools for working with geospatial data in the browser.


  **Categories include:**


  - **Mapping**  
    Libraries for building interactive web maps (list is organized under this heading; specific libraries are in the full repository).

  - **Data Processing**  
    Frontend libraries for analyzing and processing geospatial data.

  - **LiDAR (Point Clouds)**  
    Tools for visualizing and interacting with LiDAR and point cloud data:
    - **Plasio** – Drag‑and‑drop in‑browser LAS/LAZ point cloud viewer.
    - **Potree** – WebGL point cloud viewer designed for large datasets.
    - **Potree & Cesium.js demo** – Example LIDAR viewer (Rezt, Austria).
    - **Three.js PCD loader example** – WebGL point cloud data loader example.

  - **Remote Sensing / Earth Observation**  
    Frontend‑oriented resources for satellite imagery and remote sensing workflows:
    - **EOSDIS Worldview** – Interactive interface for browsing global, full‑resolution satellite imagery.
    - **Google Earth Engine** – Cloud geospatial processing platform (JavaScript API tutorials included).
    - **Sentinel Hub custom scripts** – Repository of ready‑made visualization and processing scripts for Sentinel Hub.
    - **sentinelhub-js** – JavaScript SDK for downloading and processing satellite imagery via Sentinel Hub services.
    - **Spectral** – “Awesome Spectral Indices” list for the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API.

  ### 2. Geospatial Data Sources

  A catalog of open geospatial datasets suitable for web mapping and analysis.


  **Downloads** (direct data access):

  - **ArcGIS Hub** – Portal providing access to over 380,000 open datasets.

  - **Copernicus Global DEM** – Global elevation tiles (digital elevation
  model).

  - **Copernicus Open Access Hub** – Access point for Copernicus satellite
  imagery downloads.

  - **ETOPO1** – 1‑arc‑minute global relief model of the Earth’s surface.

  - (Further European / global datasets are listed in the full repository.)


  **Web APIs & Collections**  

  Additional sections (as indicated in the contents) list:

  - Web APIs for programmatic access to geospatial data.

  - Aggregated data collections and catalogs.


  ### 3. Notebooks for Learning & Prototyping

  Organized examples and tutorials using notebooks (e.g., JS-based or other
  notebook environments) for geospatial analysis:

  - **Beginner** – Introductory GIS and web‑mapping notebooks.

  - **Intermediate** – More advanced data processing, visualization, and
  workflows.

  - **Advanced** – Complex or large‑scale geospatial analysis examples.


  ### 4. Example Web Maps and Web Apps


  - **Web maps** – Collection of live, browser-based map examples illustrating
  different visualization techniques, interaction patterns, or data types.

  - **Web apps** – Full web applications that showcase practical GIS
  functionality (e.g., dashboards, thematic explorers, interactive tools).


  ### 5. Design & UX Resources


  - **Colour Advice** – Guidance and resources for choosing color ramps and
  palettes suitable for maps and geospatial visualizations (readability,
  accessibility, thematic correctness).

  - **Icons** – Collections of map and location‑related icons for use in web GIS
  interfaces (markers, POIs, UI symbols).


  ### 6. Multimedia & Learning Materials


  - **Videos** – Talks, tutorials, and demonstrations related to frontend GIS,
  web mapping, and geospatial visualization.

  - **Further Reading** – Articles, documentation, and reference material on
  geospatial concepts, best practices, and web‑based GIS development.


  ## Pricing

  This is an open, GitHub‑hosted curated list. Access to the list itself is
  **free**.  

  (Individual tools or datasets referenced may have their own licensing or
  pricing; those are not governed by this directory.)
