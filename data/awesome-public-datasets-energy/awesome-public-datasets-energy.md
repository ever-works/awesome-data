## Overview
Awesome Public Datasets – Energy is a curated, Awesome-style subdirectory within the broader Awesome Public Datasets project. It focuses specifically on high-quality, structured datasets related to energy, power systems, and electricity usage. The directory aggregates links to well-known research and data science datasets such as AMPds, BLUEd, COMBED, DBFC, ECO, and the Global Power Plant Database.

## Features

- **Energy-focused dataset collection**  
  Curated list concentrating on energy and power-related data, including consumption, generation, and infrastructure.

- **Part of Awesome Public Datasets**  
  Integrated into the main Awesome Public Datasets project, following its structure and contribution practices.

- **Curated, research-grade datasets**  
  Emphasis on high-quality, structured datasets suitable for academic research, data science, and machine learning.

- **Coverage of well-known datasets**  
  Includes references to datasets such as:
  - AMPds (energy usage data)
  - BLUEd
  - COMBED
  - DBFC
  - ECO
  - Global Power Plant Database (global power plant information)

- **Link aggregation**  
  Provides links out to original dataset sources and documentation rather than hosting the data directly.

- **Useful for multiple use cases**  
  Applicable to work in energy analytics, load forecasting, demand response, power system planning, and related research areas.

- **Open, GitHub-based directory**  
  Hosted on GitHub, benefiting from version control, issue tracking, and community contributions.
