  ## Overview

  Awesome TAP is a curated “awesome list” of resources, libraries, and tools
  related to the Test Anything Protocol (TAP). It focuses primarily on the
  JavaScript ecosystem but is open to contributions for any language.


  TAP (Test Anything Protocol) is a simple text-based interface between testing
  modules and a test harness, used to report and consume test results.


  ## Features


  ### Scope & Focus

  - Curated list specifically dedicated to TAP (Test Anything Protocol).

  - Emphasis on JavaScript tooling, with sections reserved for other languages.

  - Organized into clear sections for easy discovery of TAP-related tooling and
  learning material.


  ### Main Sections


  #### 1. Reporters

  - Section dedicated to TAP reporters (tools that format or present TAP
  output).

  - Language-specific subsections, including:
    - **JavaScript** (list of TAP reporters for JS-based test tools).
    - **Go** (space for TAP reporters in Go).

  *(The exact reporter packages are defined in the GitHub README; the structure
  is exposed here even though specific entries are not visible in the provided
  content.)*


  #### 2. Producers

  Tools and commands that produce TAP output.


  - **JavaScript Producers** (examples given in README):
    - `ava --tap` – AVA test runner in TAP output mode.
    - `eslint --format=tap` – ESLint using TAP output format.
    - `mocha reporter=tap` – Mocha test runner using a TAP reporter.
    - `mos test --tap` – `mos` test command producing TAP output.

  - **Other Language Producers**
    - Sections allocated for:
      - **Swift**
      - **Fish** (shell)
      - **Bash**
    - Additional producers linked via external TAP resources:
      - “More…” link to TAP producers: https://testanything.org/producers.html

  #### 3. Consumers

  Things that consume or process TAP output.


  - **JavaScript Consumers**
    - Section for JS tools that read and process TAP output (e.g., test harnesses, reporters, dashboards).
    - External link for additional consumers:
      - “More…” link to TAP consumers: https://testanything.org/consumers.html

  #### 4. Tools

  General tools in the TAP ecosystem.


  - **JavaScript Tools**
    - Includes utilities that interact with TAP output; one example word visible in the content: `stdout` (indicative of tools or patterns working via standard output).

  - **Python Tools**
    - Section for TAP-related Python utilities.

  *(Exact entries are managed in the repository README.)*


  #### 5. Learning Resources


  - **Articles**

  - **Tutorials**
    - Step-by-step guides and how-tos for using TAP with various tools and languages.

  - **Documentation**
    - Official and community docs on TAP, including protocol specifications and reference materials.

  #### 6. Community & Meta

  - **Community**
    - Links to TAP-related communities (forums, chats, groups) where developers can discuss TAP.

  - **About**
    - Brief explanation of TAP and the purpose of the list.

  - **Code of Conduct**
