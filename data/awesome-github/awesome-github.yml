  GitHub provides in-browser rendering and previews for several special file
  types; the list catalogs examples and references for:

  - **GeoJSON / TopoJSON**  
    - Automatic map rendering when GeoJSON files are added to a repository.  
    - Linked examples demonstrating maps rendered directly on GitHub.

    - Links to galleries showcasing interesting notebook examples.

    - Embedded PDF viewing directly on GitHub.
  - **STL (3D model) files**  
    - 3D model viewing and interaction in the browser.
  - **CSV**  
    - In-browser CSV viewing suited for data journalism and civic data use cases.

  ### 3. Audience-Specific Organization

  - Separate sections targeting:
    - Beginners getting oriented with GitHub basics.  
    - Intermediate users looking for workflows and tools.  
    - Power users seeking advanced tips, tricks, and add-ons.  
    - People exploring non-traditional or “novel” uses of GitHub (e.g., event management, collaboration outside software).

  ### 4. Focused Scope

  - Concentrates specifically on **GitHub** as a collaboration platform (issues,
  pull requests, hosting, rendered content, and workflows), rather than Git
  itself.

  - Highlights GitHub’s role in mass collaboration and open projects beyond
  software development.


  ### 5. Community-Driven Curation

  - Open contribution model using GitHub pull requests.

  - Clear contribution guidelines referenced from the main README.
