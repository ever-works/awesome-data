  ## Overview

  Awesome Cybersecurity Blue Team is a curated, GitHub-hosted directory of

  such as defense, monitoring, and security operations. It emphasizes Free
  Software projects over proprietary solutions.


  ## Features

  - **Focus on defensive security**, including:
    - Identifying security flaws in IT systems.
    - Verifying the effectiveness of security controls.
    - Ongoing monitoring to ensure defenses remain effective over time.

  other practical resources (“shiny things”) useful for:
    - Security operations
    - Incident detection and response
    - Security monitoring
    - Defense-oriented engineering and operations.
  - **Open, Git-based structure** with repository files such as:
    - `README.md` containing the main curated list.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining how to propose additions and improvements.
    - Supporting configuration files (e.g., `.travis.yml`, `.gitignore`, GitHub workflow files under `.github`).
  - **Community-driven updates**, with a history of commits and the ability for
  users to fork and star the repository.

  - **Bias toward Free Software** projects and away from proprietary tools.


  ## Pricing

  - Not a commercial product or service; the repository and its content are
  available free of charge on GitHub.
