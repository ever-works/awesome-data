  # Awesome CakePHP


  A curated directory of CakePHP 5.x+ plugins, components, helpers, and learning
  resources, focused on task-specific functionality and granular grouping.


  ## Overview


  - **Type:** Themed directory / awesome list

  - **Ecosystem:** CakePHP (PHP framework), CakePHP 5.x+

  - **Scope:** Plugins, subparts of plugins, libraries, and learning resources

  - **Focus:** Task-specific functionality and fine-grained categorization
  beyond whole-plugin listings (e.g., plugin subparts).


  ## Features


  ### Curated Plugin & Resource Index

  - Organized collection of CakePHP plugins and libraries.

  - Includes both whole plugins and specific subparts within repositories.

  - Focus on CakePHP 5.x+ ecosystem.

  - Emphasis on task- or domain-specific solutions.


  ### Category-Based Organization

  Plugins and tools are grouped by purpose, including (but not limited to):


  - **AI Tools**
    - Integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools into CakePHP applications.

  - **Architecture**
    - Structural and architectural helpers, patterns, or scaffolding for CakePHP projects.

  - **Asset Management**
    - Managing, compressing, and minifying frontend assets (CSS, JS, images, etc.).

  - **Auditing / Logging**
    - Tracking changes, events, and activity within applications.

  - **Authentication and Authorization**
    - Implementing auth flows, user identity, permissions, and role-based access control.

  - **Caching**
    - Data caching strategies and tools for performance optimization.

  - **Code Analysis**
    - Analyzing, parsing, and manipulating PHP/CakePHP codebases.

  - **Console**
    - CLI tools, command-line utilities, and enhancements for CakePHP’s console.

  - **Debugging**
    - Debugging tools and helpers for local development and troubleshooting.

  - **Email**
    - Email transports, sending utilities, and mail-related helpers.

  - **File Manipulation**
    - File uploads, storage backends, and general file handling.

  - **Filtering and Validation**
    - Data sanitization tools, validation rules, and filter components.

  - **Geolocation**
    - Geocoding, address handling, and working with coordinates.

  - **I18n (Internationalization / Localization)**
    - Translation, locale management, and multi-language support.

  - **Imagery**
    - Image processing, transformations, and manipulation libraries.

  - **Libs (General Libraries)**
    - Useful generic libraries and tools that don’t fit into other categories.

  ### Additional Characteristics

  - Distinguishes itself from plugins.cakephp.org by:
    - Supporting plugin **subparts** (not only full repositories).
    - Offering **more granular grouping** of tools and resources.
    - Prioritizing **task-specific** functionality to help developers find targeted solutions.
  - Hosted as a public GitHub repository for easy browsing, issues, and
  contributions.


  ## Pricing


  - **Cost:** Free (open, public GitHub repository / awesome list).


  ## License


  - The repository includes a `LICENSE` file (open-source license; details
  available in the GitHub repo).
