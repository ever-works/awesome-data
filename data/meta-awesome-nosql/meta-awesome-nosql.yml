  ## Overview

  meta-awesome – NoSQL is a curated meta-list that aggregates “awesome” lists
  and resources related to NoSQL databases and their ecosystems. It serves as a
  structured entry point to discover community-maintained collections of tools,
  databases, libraries, and learning resources in the NoSQL space.


  ## Features

  - Curated meta-directory focused specifically on NoSQL topics.

  - Aggregates links to multiple “awesome” lists rather than individual
  projects.

  - Covers NoSQL databases and surrounding ecosystems (tools, libraries,
  learning material, etc.).

  - Hosted as part of the broader `meta-awesome` collection on GitHub.

  - Markdown-based document, easy to read, clone, or extend via pull requests.

  - Open, community-editable resource (subject to the repository’s contribution
  guidelines).


  ## Content Scope

  - NoSQL databases (e.g., key-value, document, columnar, graph, and other
  non-relational models).

  - Ecosystem resources such as drivers, ORMs/ODMs, utilities, and tooling
  (inferred from description as “ecosystems”).

  - Learning and reference resources collected in “awesome” list format.


  ## Pricing

  - Not a commercial product or service; it is a freely accessible, open GitHub
  document.
