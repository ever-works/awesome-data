  ## Overview

  meta-awesome: GUI is a curated meta-directory that lists “awesome” style
  directories focused on graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks, toolkits,
  and libraries. It aggregates collections of GUI-related resources rather than
  individual libraries themselves, helping developers discover broader,
  community-maintained lists in the GUI ecosystem.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-directory of GUI resources**
    - Focuses specifically on GUI-related content within the larger meta-awesome project.
    - Points to other "awesome" lists that cover GUI frameworks, toolkits, and libraries.

  - **Coverage of GUI frameworks and toolkits**
    - Includes links to directories that catalog cross-platform GUI frameworks.
    - Surfaces lists dedicated to desktop UI toolkits, web-based UI frameworks, and possibly mobile GUI abstractions (as part of linked awesome lists).

  - **Library-focused directories**
    - References awesome lists that group reusable GUI components and libraries.
    - Helps locate widget libraries, component kits, and UI helper tools through their respective awesome lists.

  - **GitHub-hosted resource**
    - Maintained as part of the `meta-awesome` GitHub repository.
    - Uses standard awesome-list formatting conventions (Markdown lists, categorized sections, GitHub links).

  - **Community-centered curation**
    - Aggregates community-maintained awesome lists rather than proprietary catalogs.
    - Benefits from GitHub’s ecosystem for updates, contributions, and external maintenance of the underlying lists.

  ## Pricing

  - Not a commercial product or service.  

  - Publicly accessible GitHub documentation; no pricing or plans are associated
  with this directory.
