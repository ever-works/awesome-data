  ## Features


  ### Scope

  - Focused on Substrate, an open-source Rust framework for building modular,
  upgradable, and efficient blockchains.

  - Community-maintained “awesome list” of Substrate-related resources and
  projects.

  - Complements more general Polkadot ecosystem lists (e.g., `awesome-dot`).


  ### Content Structure

  - **Resources**: General learning materials and references about Substrate and
  its ecosystem.

  - **Support**: Pointers to community or ecosystem channels for getting help
  (from the list itself, not product support).

  - **Social**: Links to social/community hubs related to Substrate development.

  - **Events**: References to events relevant to Substrate and Polkadot
  developers.

  - **Blogs**: Written content and articles on Substrate development and
  ecosystem updates.

  - **Videos**: Video tutorials, talks, and presentations on Substrate.


  ### Technical and Developer Sections

  - **Templates**: Starter projects and boilerplates for building
  Substrate-based blockchains and related tools. Examples mentioned:
    - `substrate-stencil`
    - `@polkadot/api`
    - `useInkathon`

  - **FRAME Pallets**: Collection of reusable runtime modules (pallets) for the
  FRAME framework, enabling common blockchain functionality.


  - **Framework Extensions**: Extensions and add-ons that enhance or extend
  Substrate’s core framework capabilities.


  - **Client Libraries**: Libraries for interacting with Substrate-based chains
  from different languages and environments. Examples mentioned:
    - `go-substrate-gen`
    - `sube`
    - `subxt`
    - `useInkathon`

  - **Mobile**: Resources and tools specific to mobile interaction with
  Substrate-based blockchains.


  - **Tools**: A broad collection of utilities supporting development, testing,
  deployment, telemetry, and analysis of Substrate chains. Examples include:
    - `offline-election`
    - `offchain::ipfs`
    - `polkadot-js-bundle`
    - `polkadot-launch`
    - `polkadot-runtime-prom-exporter`
    - `polkadot-scripts`
    - `polkadot-starship`
    - `srtool-actions`
    - `srtool`
    - `srtool-cli`
    - `subsee`
    - `subalfred`
    - `substrate-balance-calculator`
    - `substrate-balance-graph`
    - `substrate-graph-benchmarks`
    - `substrate-js-utils`
    - `substrate-society`
    - `substrate-toml-lint`
    - `subwasm`
    - `sup`
    - `scale-value`
    - `serde_json`
    - `Value`
    - `scale-info`
    - `scale-decode`

  - **Products and Services**: Directory of third-party products or services
  built on, or supporting, Substrate.


  - **Alternative Implementations**: Links to non-reference or alternative
  implementations relevant to Substrate or its components.


  - **SCALE Codec**: Resources and tooling around the SCALE (Simple Concatenated
  Aggregate Little-Endian) codec used by Substrate.


  ### Meta

  - **License**: Repository includes a `LICENSE` file specifying terms for using
  the list content.

  - **Contributing**: `contributing.md` describes how community members can
  submit new entries or improvements to the list.
