# Awesome Tiny JS

**Website:** <https://github.com/thoughtspile/awesome-tiny-js#readme>

## Overview
Awesome Tiny JS is a curated “awesome list” of ultra-small frontend JavaScript libraries and tools, focused on minimizing bundle size. It highlights libraries typically under 2 kB (with a slightly higher cap for UI frameworks) that can be used to build lightweight web interfaces.

## Category
- Themed directories / Awesome list

## Key Details
- **Scope:** Frontend JavaScript libraries and tools
- **Primary criterion:** Very small bundle size (≈ ≤ 2 kB; UI frameworks up to ~4.5 kB)
- **Use case:** Lightweight web projects where bundle size and performance are priorities
- **Format:** GitHub-based curated list with README and supporting docs (e.g., contributing guidelines, WIP and incubator lists)

## Features
- **Curated collection of tiny JS libraries**
  - Focused on front-end libraries that significantly reduce bundle size.
  - Emphasis on “tiny” alternatives to common tooling and frameworks.

- **Size-constrained selection**
  - Most entries are under 2 kB.
  - UI frameworks section explicitly allows up to ~4.5 kB, treating them as special but still very small.

- **UI frameworks section**
  - Covers minimal UI frameworks that provide:
    - Declarative templates.
    - Event bindings.
    - Observable state to drive view updates.
  - Distinguishes between more established options and “openly experimental” libraries.

- **Popularity and ecosystem context**
  - Notes that many listed frameworks are significantly less popular than mainstream options like Preact.
  - Links to npm trends comparisons to show usage and adoption.

- **Experimental and niche libraries**
  - Includes an “openly experimental” subset of UI libraries (e.g., Fre, VanJS core, Superfine, Arrow.js core), inviting exploration of cutting-edge or unconventional approaches.

- **Repository structure for collaboration**
  - `contributing.md` for contribution guidelines.
  - `incubate.md` and `wip.md` for works-in-progress and candidate libraries.
  - Image assets for logos and category visuals.
