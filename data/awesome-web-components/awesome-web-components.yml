  ## Description

  Awesome Web Components is a curated, community-maintained list of resources
  for learning, building, and working with Web Components. It aggregates
  standards documentation, guides, example components, libraries, frameworks
  integrations, tools, and learning materials related to the Web Components
  ecosystem.


  ## Features


  ### Scope & Focus

  - Curated, categorized list focused specifically on Web Components.

  - Covers both core Web Components standards and surrounding ecosystem
  (libraries, tools, usage examples, learning content).

  - Previously known as **"Web Components the Right Way"**.


  ### Web Components Standards Coverage

  - **Custom Elements**
    - Resources on defining and using custom DOM elements.
    - Emphasis on fully-featured, reusable elements.
  - **Shadow DOM**
    - Resources explaining DOM tree composition and encapsulation.
    - Focus on component isolation and composition patterns.
  - **HTML Templates**
    - Usage of the `<template>` element for reusable markup fragments.
    - Guidance on cloning and inserting templates via script.
  - **CSS Shadow Parts**
    - Styling hooks for elements inside Shadow DOM via `::part()` / `part`.
    - Resources on exposing and consuming shadow parts for theming.

  ### Guides & Best Practices
