# Awesome Electric Guitar Specifications

**Description:**
A structured, “awesome-style” checklist and reference for designing and assembling solid‑body electric guitars, with a focus on how individual specifications affect sound and playability.

## Features

### Purpose & Scope
- Top‑down checklist for building solid‑body electric guitars
- Emphasis on achieving specific sound and playability characteristics
- Organized by major components and design factors
- Suitable for custom builds, modifications, and planning instrument specs

### Main Sections
- **Sound and Playability Influencing Factors**
  - Overview of how each component affects sound vs. playability
  - Influence weighting table:
    - Guitar Neck: low sound influence, very strong playability influence
    - Guitar Body: low sound influence, very strong playability influence
    - Guitar Electronics: strong sound influence, little playability influence
    - Strings: moderate influence on both sound and playability
    - Scale Length: low but present influence on both
    - Woods (body, neck, fretboard): low but present influence on both
  - Clarified scale for influence ("-" = little, "++++" = very strong)
  - Example guidance for targeting a specific style (e.g., jazz‑sounding solid‑body guitar) via top‑down choices

- **Guitar Necks**
  - Dedicated section for neck design and specification
  - Neck‑related impact on playability (highest rating in table)
  - Coverage implied (from structure and images): profile, construction, and setup considerations for necks

- **Guitar Bodies**
  - Section for body specifications
  - Focus on ergonomics and playability plus some tonal influence

- **Tuning Machines**
  - Checklist of tuning hardware needed
  - Considerations tied to stability and usability

- **Bridges**
  - Bridge types and related hardware choices
  - Setup implications for playability and intonation

- **Hardware Parts Checklist**
  - Consolidated list of required hardware components
  - Helps ensure all mechanical parts are accounted for in a build

- **Electronics**
  - Strong focus on sound‑shaping components
  - Pickups and wiring as primary tonal influencers
  - Part of the overall signal‑shaping design process

- **Strings**
  - String type and gauge as mid‑level influencers on sound and feel

- **Scale Length**
  - How scale length choices affect tension, feel, and tonal response

- **Woods**
  - Body, neck, and fretboard wood categories
  - Relative influence of wood choices on sound and playability

### Visual Aids & Structure
- Diagrams and images illustrating:
  - Overall sound and playability factors
  - Guitar neck overview
  - General pickup / electronics layout
- Clear table of contents with anchor links to each major section
- “Top‑down” approach encourages starting from desired sound/playability and working down through each component choice

### Project & Contribution
- Hosted as a GitHub repository with:
  - `README.md` (main specs and checklist)
  - `index.html` and `template.html` for web rendering of specs
  - `contributing.md` with license and contribution guidelines
  - `images` directory for diagrams
- Marked as an **Awesome**-style list (compliant with awesome.re guidelines)
