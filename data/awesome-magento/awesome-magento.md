## Overview

Awesome Magento is a curated, community-driven directory of Magento 2 extensions, tools, and learning resources. It focuses on the Magento 2 ecosystem, including open source projects, events, and educational materials.

## What is Magento?

Magento is an open-source e-commerce platform for creating webshops, consisting of:
- **Frontend:** Storefront where customers browse and purchase products.
- **Backend:** Admin panel for managing products, customers, and configuration.

Key characteristics:
- **Open source:** Distributed under OSL v3, allowing reuse and modification of the codebase (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, XML, etc.).
- **Versions & history:**
  - Magento 1: first released in 2008 by Varien.
  - Magento 2: first released in November 2015.
- **Ecosystem evolution:**
  - Magento 2 initially faced adoption challenges due to complex architecture and some outdated technologies (e.g., KnockoutJS, RequireJS, Zend Framework 1).
  - This led to various alternative storefront/front-end solutions.
- **Adobe acquisition & branding:**
  - Acquired by Adobe in 2018.
  - Magento Enterprise integrated into Adobe Commerce Cloud.
  - Magento Community Edition rebranded as **Magento Open Source**.
- **Community initiatives:**
  - Community uncertainty about the long-term direction of Magento Open Source under Adobe led to the creation of **Mage-OS**, a community-driven initiative.
