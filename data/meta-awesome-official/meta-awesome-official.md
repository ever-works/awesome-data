## Description
A curated section of the Meta Awesome project that indexes *official* awesome lists and primary resources maintained directly by core project teams or recognized organizations. It helps users find canonical or organization-backed "awesome" collections rather than community-maintained forks or derivatives.

## Features
- **Index of official awesome lists**
  - Focuses on awesome lists explicitly maintained by core teams, foundations, or official organizations behind a technology, tool, or ecosystem.
- **Primary resource curation**
  - Includes links to main documentation hubs, central directories, or primary portals associated with each official awesome list when available.
- **Meta-directory structure**
  - Acts as a higher-level directory over many awesome lists, organizing them in a single document for easier discovery.
- **Quality and authenticity emphasis**
  - Filters for sources that are authoritative or canonical, helping users avoid outdated, unofficial, or duplicate lists.
- **GitHub-based maintenance**
  - Hosted and versioned on GitHub, enabling community visibility, pull requests, and transparent change history.
