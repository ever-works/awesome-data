  # Awesome Idris


  A curated, community-maintained directory of resources for **Idris**, a
  general-purpose pure functional programming language with dependent types.


  Idris supports dependent types, where types can depend on values, enabling
  precise specifications of program behaviour at the type level. It is a
  compiled language with eager evaluation, influenced by Haskell and ML.
