  ## Overview


  `awesome-asm` is a themed directory focused on assembly language, aggregating
  learning resources, tools, and reference materials. It is part of a broader
  "Malware and Reverse Engineering" collection, which includes links useful to
  low-level programming, malware analysis, and reverse engineering.


  ## Features


  ### Curated Resource Collection

  - Collects links relevant to assembly and low-level software analysis from
  reputable sources.

  - Organized within the broader "Malware and Reverse Engineering Complete
  Collection" structure.


  ### Contextual Learning Material (Malware & Reverse Engineering)

  While the core directory targets assembly resources, it is embedded in a
  collection that also links to background topics frequently associated with
  assembly work:


  - **Malware analysis primers**  
    Links to explain what malware analysis is, typical processes, and conceptual overviews:
    - CrowdStrike: malware analysis overview
    - Wikipedia: malware analysis
    - Sectigo Store: what malware analysis is and how it works
    - Digital Guardian: defining and outlining malware analysis processes
    - SANS whitepaper and SANS blog entries on learning malware analysis
    - Logsign blog: malware analysis essentials
    - FIRST malware SIG
    - OPSWAT: malware analysis solutions overview
    - Medium article: malware analysis concepts
    - Jigsaw Academy blog: malware analysis basics

  - **Reverse engineering introductions**  
    Links that define reverse engineering and explain common use cases and processes:
