  **Category:** Meta Directories  
  **Tags:** dependency-injection, programming, meta-directory

  ## Overview
  Meta Awesome – Dependency Injection is a curated meta-directory that aggregates “awesome” style lists and resources focused on dependency injection (DI) frameworks and patterns. It serves as a central entry point to DI-related libraries, frameworks, articles, and learning materials maintained in other awesome lists.

  ## Features
  - **Meta-directory of DI resources**  
    Central hub that links out to multiple curated “awesome” lists and repositories focused on dependency injection.

  - **Focus on dependency injection frameworks**  
    Collects references to frameworks and libraries that implement or support DI across various programming languages.

  - **Coverage of DI patterns and concepts**  
    Includes resources on design patterns, best practices, and architectural approaches related to dependency injection.

  - **Curated external awesome lists**  
    Primarily links to other community-maintained awesome lists rather than duplicating their content, acting as an index.

  - **Programming-language agnostic**  
    Aims to span multiple languages and ecosystems by referencing DI resources from different tech stacks.

  - **Documentation-style format**  
    Provided as a Markdown document within the `meta-awesome` GitHub repository, easy to browse and contribute to.

  - **Open, GitHub-hosted resource**  
    Accessible as a public GitHub document, benefiting from community contributions, versioning, and pull requests.
