  - Many datasets tailored for mining software repositories (MSR) research.
  - Datasets that can also be reused for search-based software engineering.

- **Catalog of research tools**
  - Tools that support data-driven analysis of software systems.
  - Utilities for working with and mining software repositories.

- **Focus on empirical / experimental software engineering**
  - Emphasizes evidence-based research practices.
  - Targets studies relying on real project data and repositories.

- **Research-oriented organization**
  - Structured as an "awesome" list for easy browsing and discovery.
  - Includes repository metadata such as license, contributing guidelines, and code of conduct for community contributions.

## Audience
- Researchers in empirical software engineering and MSR.
- Practitioners and students needing real-world software datasets.
- Developers exploring tools and resources for data-driven software research.

## Pricing
- Not a commercial product; this is an open GitHub repository.  
- Access to the list and linked resources is free (subject to the licenses of individual datasets/tools).
