**Category:** Themed Directories  
**Tags:** algorithms, interview, programming

## Overview
Leetcode Patterns is a curated GitHub repository that organizes LeetCode programming problems by common patterns and subtopics. It provides a structured way to practice coding interview questions for software engineering roles, focusing on pattern recognition rather than random problem selection.

## Features
- **Pattern-based organization of LeetCode problems**  
  - Problems grouped by common patterns and subtopics to encourage repeated practice of similar ideas.  
  - Entire question list available via a dedicated site: https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/

- **Interview-focused problem set**  
  - Designed for improving problem-solving skills specifically for software engineering interviews.  
  - Questions sourced from LeetCode (some require LeetCode Premium).  
  - Influenced by well-known interview resources (Grokking the Coding Interview, Blind 75, and pattern-based interview articles).

- **Fundamentals guidance**  
  - Recommends core data structures to understand (and their methods/runtimes):
    - Arrays
    - Maps
    - Linked Lists
    - Queues
    - Heaps
    - Stacks
    - Trees
    - Graphs
  - Highlights key algorithms to know:
    - Breadth-first search (BFS)
    - Depth-first search (DFS)
    - Binary search
    - Recursion

- **Supplemental notes and references (Java-focused)**  
  - Linked PDF covering main Java data structures.  
  - References to useful Java methods:
    - `substring()`
    - `toCharArray()`
    - `Math.max()` / `Math.min()`
    - `Arrays.fill()`

- **Solution branch**  
  - Java solutions available in a dedicated `solutions` branch of the repository.

- **Community contributions**  
  - Suggestions for adding/removing questions or requesting new features handled via GitHub issues.
