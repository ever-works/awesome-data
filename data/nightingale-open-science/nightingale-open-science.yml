  ## Features

  ### Dataset Access
  - Primary access via Globus following documented instructions.
  - Previous cloud access at app.nightingalescience.org has been retired.
  - Data are accessed in a controlled environment; downloads are not allowed.
  - Restricted to non-commercial use.

  ### Available Datasets

  **Waveforms**
  - `ed-bwh-ecg`
  - `silent-cchs-ecg`
  - `arrest-ntuh-ecg`
  - `mcmed-stanford-multi`

  **Microscopy Images**
  - `brca-psj-path`
  - `tb-wellgen-smear`

  **X-ray Images**
  - `mrkr-emory-xray`
  - `fracture-aimi-xray`

  **Multiple Diagnostics**
  - `tamil-jpal-multi`

  ### Dataset Characteristics
  - Focus on complex **medical images and signals**:
    - X-rays
    - ECG waveforms
    - Digital pathology / microscopy images
    - Additional modalities planned (“more to come”).
  - Each dataset is built around challenging **clinical problems** where machine learning may be especially impactful (e.g., heart attack, cancer metastasis, cardiac arrest, bone aging, COVID-19).
  - Every image or signal is linked to at least one **ground truth outcome** (what actually happened to the patient), rather than relying on clinician labels.
  - **Diverse data sources**:
    - Collaborations with health systems across the US and globally.
    - Inclusion of under-resourced health systems whose data are typically underrepresented in machine learning.

  ### Governance, Privacy, and Ethics
  - All datasets are **fully de-identified**.
  - **No local download** of raw data permitted; access is controlled in the platform environment.
  - **Non-commercial use only**, to support open, broadly beneficial research.
