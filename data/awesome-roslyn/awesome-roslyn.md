## Overview
Awesome Roslyn is a curated directory of learning resources and open‑source projects built around Roslyn, the .NET Compiler Platform for C# and VB.NET. It organizes books, tutorials, analyzers, code fixes, refactorings, source generators, and related tooling for developers working with Roslyn-based code analysis and compiler extensions.

## Features

- **Focused on Roslyn / .NET Compiler Platform**  
  - Covers Roslyn compilers and code analysis APIs for C# and Visual Basic .NET.

- **Organized Resource Categories**  
  - **Books** – Introductory and in‑depth books to learn Roslyn concepts and APIs.  
  - **Tutorials** – Step‑by‑step online tutorials for creating:  
    - analyzers  
    - code fixes  
    - source generators
  - **Open Source Projects** – Examples of applications and tools built on top of Roslyn.  
  - **Open Source Analyzers, Code Fixes, and Refactorings** – Collections of reusable analyzers and refactoring tools that extend the C# and VB.NET developer experience.  
  - **Libraries and Frameworks for Testing** – Tools and frameworks specifically for testing:  
    - analyzers  
    - code fixes  
    - refactorings
  - **Source Generators** – Experimental and established source generators, plus projects that use source generators internally (noting early support around .NET 5.0 / C# 9.0).  
  - **Blog Posts and Articles** – Articles and posts on topics such as performance and broader Roslyn usage.

- **Curated “Awesome List” Format**  
  - Follows the community “awesome list” convention for structured, maintained lists.  
  - Backed by community contribution guidelines and a code of conduct (via `contributing.md` and `code-of-conduct.md`).

- **Developer-Oriented Scope**  
  - Targets .NET and tooling developers building:  
    - static analysis tools  
    - refactoring helpers  
    - custom compilers or language tooling  
    - code generation via source generators.

## Pricing

- **Free** – The Awesome Roslyn list and all its content are freely accessible as a public GitHub repository. Individual linked resources or books may have their own licensing or pricing, but the directory itself is free to use.
