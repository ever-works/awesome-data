  # LAW Network Datasets


  **URL:** <http://law.di.unimi.it/datasets.php>


  ## Overview

  The LAW Network Datasets, maintained by the Laboratory for Web Algorithmics
  (LAW) at the University of Milan, provide large-scale web and hyperlink graph
  datasets. These datasets are suitable for experiments in web mining, graph
  algorithms, and network analysis, and are distributed in highly compressed
  formats.


  ## Features

  - **Large-Scale Graph Collections**
    - Web and network graphs organized into homogeneous groups.
    - Each group includes multiple graph instances.

  - **Highly Compressed Graph Format**
    - Graphs compressed using:
      - LLP (Layered Label Propagation).
      - WebGraph framework.
    - For each graph/group, metadata typically includes:
      - Crawl date.
      - Number of nodes.
      - Number of arcs.
      - Bits per link for the highly compressed version.
      - Compression ratio relative to the information-theoretical lower bound.

  - **Multiple Compression/Access Trade-offs**
    - A highly compressed version (optimized for space and reporting compression ratios).
    - A general-usage version with faster random access but worse compression ratio.

  - **Software Ecosystem Integration**
    - **Java WebGraph**: Datasets can be downloaded and used via the Java WebGraph library.
    - **Rust WebGraph**: Usage supported via the Rust implementation of WebGraph (crate `webgraph`).
    - **JGraphT Integration**:
      - Graphs can be loaded and analyzed in JGraphT using WebGraph adapters.
      - For graphs with fewer than 2³¹ arcs, a serialized succinct JGraphT representation is provided.

  - **Documentation & Tutorial**
    - A dedicated tutorial explains how to download and use the datasets with WebGraph (Java and Rust versions).

  - **Data Provenance and Tools Acknowledgment**
    - Clear guidance on how to acknowledge:
      - WebGraph compression framework.
      - LLP ordering method.
      - Rust version of WebGraph.
      - UbiCrawler (for datasets gathered with this crawler).
      - BUbiNG (for datasets gathered with this crawler).

  ## Integrations

  - Java WebGraph

  - Rust WebGraph (`webgraph` crate)

  - JGraphT (via WebGraph adapters and succinct serialized representations)


  ## Usage & Citation Requirements

  When publishing results based on these graphs, users are expected to:

  - Cite the WebGraph framework and LLP compression papers.

  - Cite the Rust WebGraph paper if the Rust implementation is used.

  - Cite UbiCrawler and/or BUbiNG papers when using datasets gathered with those
  crawlers.
