## Description
Meta Awesome is a curated, hierarchical index of "awesome" lists—community-maintained collections of high‑quality resources—organized by topic (e.g., AI, Android, Algorithms, Audio). Each linked document (such as `acl.md`, `ai.md`, `api.md`) is itself an awesome-style collection, making this repository a meta-directory for discovering other awesome lists.

## Features
- **Meta index of awesome lists**: Aggregates many topic-specific awesome lists into a single, structured directory.
- **Hierarchical organization**: Uses a folder and document structure (`doc/*.md`) to categorize lists by subject area.
- **Topic-based navigation**: Provides direct links to themed awesome lists, including (partial list from the repo navigation):
  - ACL
  - AI
  - API
  - Actors
  - Admins
  - Advanced Console UIs
  - Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Alternative Loops
  - Analytics

- **Awesome-style documents**: Each topic file (e.g., `ai.md`, `api.md`) follows the familiar "awesome list" format, acting as its own curated resource list.
- **Repository-based access**: Distributed as a public GitHub repository, enabling cloning, forking, and local browsing.
- **Community-aligned structure**: Follows the general conventions of the broader "awesome" ecosystem for consistency and ease of use.

## Pricing
- **Free**: Public GitHub repository, accessible at no cost for viewing, cloning, and forking.
