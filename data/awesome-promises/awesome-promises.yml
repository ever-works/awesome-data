  libraries, and tools for working with JavaScript Promises. It is part of the
  broader "Awesome" collection of developer-focused lists.


  ## Features


  ### Curated Learning Resources

  - **Resources, Blogs, and Books** focused on JavaScript Promises.

  - Sections for different experience levels:
    - **For beginners** – introductory materials to understand Promises.
    - **Deep Dive** – advanced and in-depth articles or materials.
    - **References** – reference-style documentation and guides.

  ### Library & Implementation Directory

  - **Promises/A+ Implementations (ES6/ES2015 compatible)**
    - **Strict Implementations**
      - Implement no more or less than the ES6 Promise specification.
      - Intended as polyfills and highly compatible with native promises.
    - **Implementations with extras**
      - Promise libraries that extend standard behavior while remaining compatible.
      - Designed for both Node.js and browser environments.
      - Example helper methods/utilities mentioned:
        - `nodeify`
        - `denodify`
        - `done()`
    - **Fallbacks**
      - Lightweight Promise-like utilities for environments lacking full support.
      - Example: `pinkie`.

  ### Convenience Utilities for Promises

  - Focus on small, focused modules that enhance native or spec-compliant
  Promises.

  - **sindresorhus’s Promise utilities** (grouped as “promise-fun”):
    - Enhancements and helpers around:
      - `.then()`
      - `.catch()`
      - `Promise.race()`
      - `Promise#try()`
      - `Promise#finally()`
      - `Promise.all()`
      - Working with `Map` and `Object` in async contexts.
  - **Other Promise utilities and patterns**:
    - `bluebird.method`
