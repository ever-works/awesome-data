**Focus:** Open-access brain MRI and related data for normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease research

## Overview
The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a collection of freely available neuroimaging datasets designed to support basic and clinical neuroscience research. The project compiles and distributes multimodal brain imaging and associated clinical, cognitive, and biomarker data, with a primary focus on normal aging, cognitive decline, and Alzheimer’s disease.

OASIS datasets are hosted via NITRC-IR and span a broad demographic, cognitive, and genetic spectrum, providing an accessible resource for neuroimaging, clinical, and cognitive research.
