  ## Overview

  Awesome Fortran is a curated directory of Fortran frameworks, libraries,
  tools, and learning resources. It organizes community-maintained links into
  structured categories to help developers find libraries and materials for
  scientific and general-purpose Fortran development.


  ## Features

  - **Curated Fortran ecosystem list**
    - Focus on "awesome" (actively maintained, high-quality) Fortran projects and resources
    - Encourages community contributions via pull requests and issues
    - Excludes unmaintained projects (not updated in the past 6 months)

  - **Functional Libraries**
    - Section dedicated to functional-style Fortran libraries

  - **Graphics Libraries**
    - Libraries for graphing and visualization
    - Graphics-related toolkits
    - GUI (graphical user interface) libraries for Fortran

  - **Math Libraries**
    - Libraries for numerical computation
    - General mathematical operations and algorithms

  - **JSON Manipulation**
    - Libraries for working with JSON data in Fortran
    - Parsing, generating, and manipulating JSON structures

  - **XML Manipulation**
    - Libraries for parsing and generating XML
    - Tools for XML-based data workflows in Fortran

  - **Date and Time Manipulation**
    - Utilities for handling dates, times, and related calculations in Fortran

  - **Testing**
    - Frameworks and tools for testing Fortran codebases
    - Libraries for generating test data and structuring test suites

  - **Encoding / Decoding**
    - Libraries for encoding and decoding data in various formats using Fortran

  - **Portability Enabling**
    - Libraries aimed at improving code portability across platforms and compilers
