  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – i18n is a curated subdirectory within the Meta Awesome project
  focused on internationalization (i18n), localization, and language support
  tooling. It aggregates links to “awesome lists” and other resources that help
  developers build and maintain multilingual and locale-aware applications.


  ## Features

  - **Curated i18n focus** – Dedicated to resources around internationalization,
  localization, and language tooling.

  - **Meta-directory of awesome lists** – Organizes and links out to multiple
  i18n-related awesome lists rather than being a single monolithic list.

  - **Developer-centric resources** – Targets developers needing guidance,
  tools, and references for building multilingual and locale-aware software.

  - **Tooling coverage** – Highlights tools involved in language support such as
  formatting, translation workflows, locale data, and related utilities (as
  provided in linked lists).

  - **Ecosystem overview** – Serves as an entry point to explore the broader
  ecosystem of i18n resources across different languages, frameworks, and
  platforms.

  - **Open GitHub-hosted directory** – Publicly available markdown document on
  GitHub, easy to browse, clone, or contribute to.


  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable – this is an open, GitHub-hosted curated directory of links
  and resources.
