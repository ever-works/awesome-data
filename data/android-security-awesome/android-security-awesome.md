## Overview
Android Security Awesome is a curated, open-source directory of Android security resources. It aggregates tools, online services, academic and research materials, and information on exploits and vulnerabilities related to Android applications and devices.

## Features

### 1. Organized Resource Collection
- Structured sections for:
  - **Tools**
  - **Academic / Research / Publications / Books**
  - **Exploits / Vulnerabilities / Bugs**
- Focused specifically on **Android security** for both apps and devices.

### 2. Tools
The directory maintains categorized links to Android security tools, including:

#### Online Analyzers
- **AndroTotal** – Online multi-engine analysis for Android applications.
- **Appknox** – Commercial online Android app security analysis platform (not free).
- **VirusTotal** – Multi-engine malware scanning service (Android APK support, max 128 MB per file).
- **Fraunhofer App-Ray** – Commercial Android app risk and security analysis platform (not free).
- **NowSecure Lab Automated** – Automated mobile app security testing service.

> Note: The full repository includes additional tools beyond those partially visible here (static analysis, dynamic analysis, reversing, forensics, etc.), all focused on Android security.

### 3. Academic / Research / Publications / Books
- Dedicated section for:
  - Peer-reviewed research papers
  - Academic publications
  - Books and formal study materials related to Android security, exploitation, and defense.

### 4. Exploits / Vulnerabilities / Bugs
- Collection of references to:
  - Publicly known Android vulnerabilities
  - Exploit writeups and proof-of-concept code
  - Bug reports and security issues affecting Android OS and apps.

### 5. Open-Source Repository Structure
- Public GitHub repository with:
  - **README.md** – main categorized list
  - **LICENSE** – Apache-2.0
  - **contributing.md** – contribution guidelines
  - **Makefile** and scripts (e.g., `run_awesome_bot.sh`) to help maintain link quality and repository consistency.
- Community-driven, accepting contributions via pull requests.

## Pricing
- The repository itself is **free** and open source under the Apache-2.0 license.
- Some linked tools/services within the directory are **commercial** or **not free** (e.g., Appknox, Fraunhofer App-Ray, NowSecure offerings), but they are external products; this repository only lists them and does not sell them.

## Use Cases
- Security researchers compiling tooling for Android app analysis and exploitation.
- Mobile developers learning about securing Android applications.
- Penetration testers building a toolkit for Android assessments.
- Students and academics gathering Android security references and literature.
