  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** robotics, hardware, education


  ## Description

  Awesome Robotics is a curated GitHub list of robotics resources, including
  books, courses, software, libraries, and other educational materials. It aims
  to collect useful robotics learning and development resources in one place for
  learners, researchers, and practitioners.


  ## Features

  - Curated list format hosted on GitHub

  - Focus on learning and working with robotics

  - Organized into multiple resource types, including:
    - **Courses** (robotics-related educational courses; section present, individual items not listed in provided content)
    - **Books** (robotics-related books; section present, individual items not listed in provided content)
    - **Software and Libraries**, including for example:
      - **Gazebo** – Robot simulator for testing and validating robotic systems in virtual environments
      - **ROS (Robot Operating System)** – Flexible framework for writing robot software; includes tools, libraries, and conventions for building complex, robust robot behavior across many platforms
      - **ROS2** – Newer version of ROS with significant design changes and improvements over the original ROS
      - **RobWork** – Collection of C++ libraries for simulation and control of robot systems; used in research, education, and practical robot applications
      - **MRPT (Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit)** – Portable, well-tested applications and libraries providing common data structures and algorithms for mobile robotics research
      - **Robotics Library (RL)** – Self-contained C++ library covering kinematics, motion planning and control, dynamics, hardware abstraction, collision detection, and visualization
      - **Simbad** – 2D/3D robot simulation environment
  - Open contribution model with a CONTRIBUTING guide available in the
  repository
