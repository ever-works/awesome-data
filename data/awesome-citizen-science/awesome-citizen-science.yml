  # Awesome Citizen Science


  **URL:** https://github.com/dylanrees/citizen-science#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** science, community, research


  ## Overview

  Awesome Citizen Science is a curated, open directory of software, tools,
  spaces, and educational resources that support citizen science,
  community-based research, and non‑institutional scientific practice. It is
  part of the broader "Awesome" list ecosystem and emphasizes free and
  open‑source options where possible.


  ## Features


  ### Scope and Focus

  - Curated repository of resources for:
    - Citizen science
    - Community-based science
    - Non-institutional and DIY science
  - Emphasis on tools that help communities use scientific methods and
  instruments.

  - Inspired by similar "awesome" tool lists for activists and technologists.


  ### Software

  Organized collection of digital tools useful for citizen science workflows:

  - **Lab Equipment Software**
    - Software that interfaces with or controls lab equipment.
    - Tools for measurement, data logging, or experimentation.
  - **Modeling and Computation**
    - Simulation, data analysis, and numerical modeling tools.
    - Computational environments and frameworks relevant to scientific work.
  - **Publishing, Collaboration, and Organization**
    - Tools to write, publish, and share research outputs.
    - Platforms for collaborative work, documentation, and project management.
  - **Graphs and Visualization**
    - Tools to create plots, graphs, and visualizations of scientific data.

  ### Educational Resources

  - Section dedicated to educational materials related to:
    - Citizen science methods and practice.
    - Learning scientific concepts in community and DIY contexts.

  ### Tools and Physical Equipment

  Curated lists of hardware-focused tools and equipment, organized by domain:

  - **Biology and Chemistry**
    - Lab tools, kits, and devices for biological and chemical experiments.
  - **Environmental Science and Geology**
    - Field instruments and tools for monitoring and measuring environmental variables.
  - **3D Printing and Fabrication**
    - Fabrication tools for building custom instruments, enclosures, and experimental setups.
  - **Electronics**
    - Electronic components, kits, and hardware platforms relevant to instrumentation.
  - **Other**
    - Miscellaneous tools that support experimental or observational work.

  ### Publishing and Doing Research

  - Resources to support the research lifecycle outside traditional
  institutions:
    - Guides and tools for designing studies.
    - Approaches to documentation, data management, and sharing results.

  ### Literature

  Curated reading lists related to citizen science:

  - **Citizen Science Theory**
    - Conceptual and theoretical works about citizen and community science.
  - **Citizen Science Practice**
    - Case studies, how‑to guides, and practical reflections on doing citizen science.

  ### Citizen Science Spaces and Projects

  Directory of projects and physical/organizational spaces:

  - **Genetics / Biohacking**
    - Community labs and projects focused on genetics, molecular biology, and biohacking.
  - **Environment**
    - Community monitoring, environmental justice, and ecology-related projects.
  - **Other**
    - Additional citizen science initiatives that don’t fit neatly into the above categories.

  ### Art and Science Spaces

  - List of interdisciplinary, community-driven labs and spaces that combine:
    - Art, science, technology, and DIY/maker culture.
  - Emphasis on:
    - Member-led structures.
    - Curiosity-driven projects.
    - Work that crosses disciplinary boundaries (e.g., bio-art).

  ### Funding and Support

  Resources to help sustain citizen science work:

  - **Financial Resources**
    - Potential funding sources or references for grants and financial support.
  - **Other Types of Support**
    - Non-financial support, such as mentorship, institutional partnerships, or in-kind resources.

  ### Conferences and Events

  - Listing of events and gatherings relevant to:
    - Citizen science practitioners.
    - Community labs and DIY science communities.

  ### Other Resources

  - Miscellaneous materials that support or contextualize citizen science
  practice, not captured in other sections.


  ### Questions and Knowledge Gaps

  - Section highlighting open questions and areas where new tools or resources
  are needed.

  - Helps contributors identify where contributions could be most impactful.


  ### Contribution Guidelines

  - Clear instructions on how to propose additions or changes:
    - Contributions via GitHub issues.
    - Separate `contributing.md` file describing contribution process.
  - Preference stated for free and open-source software when adding tools.
