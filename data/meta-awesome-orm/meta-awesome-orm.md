## Overview
Meta Awesome - ORM is a curated meta-directory that indexes "awesome" lists focused on ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools and frameworks. It aggregates multiple community-maintained lists into a single reference, helping developers discover ORM libraries, tools, and related resources across languages and ecosystems.

## Features
- **Meta index of ORM awesome lists** – Collects and links to multiple "awesome" lists specifically about ORM tools and frameworks.
- **ORM-focused scope** – Concentrates on Object-Relational Mapping technologies, rather than general-purpose development resources.
- **Multi-language coverage** (implied by awesome-list style) – Intended to surface ORM solutions across different programming languages and stacks.
- **GitHub-hosted documentation** – The index is maintained as a Markdown document within a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, fork, and contribute.
- **Community-editable** – Can be updated via standard GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests) to add or refine indexed lists.
- **Categorized as a meta-directory** – Serves as a higher-level directory that points to other specialized directories (awesome lists) instead of individual tools only.
