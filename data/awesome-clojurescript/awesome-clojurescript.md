## Overview
Awesome ClojureScript is a community-driven, curated directory of tools, libraries, frameworks, and learning resources for ClojureScript developers. The list is maintained as an open GitHub repository and focuses on ecosystem coverage rather than any single tool or vendor.

## Features
- **Community-Driven Curation**  
  - Open contribution model via pull requests.  
  - Guidelines for contributors (CONTRIBUTING.md) including formatting and alphabetical ordering of entries.

- **Broad Ecosystem Coverage**  
  The list organizes ClojureScript-related projects and resources into multiple categories, including:
  - **Books** – Learning materials and published texts on ClojureScript.  
  - **Courses** – Structured learning paths and online classes.  
  - **Videos** – Screencasts, talks, and recorded tutorials.

- **Technical Libraries & Tools by Category**  
  - **Canvas** – Libraries for working with HTML5 canvas and drawing APIs from ClojureScript.  
  - **Client/Server Communication** – Tools and libraries for HTTP, RPC, APIs, and general client–server interaction.  
  - **Code Analysis** – Static analysis, linting, and code inspection tools for ClojureScript.  
  - **Data Serialization** – Tools for encoding and decoding data formats (e.g., JSON, transit, etc.).  
  - **Data Visualization** – Charting, graphing, and visualization libraries.  
  - **Database** – Client-side or ClojureScript-oriented database and storage libraries.  
  - **Development** – Tooling for development workflows such as REPLs, build tools, hot reloading, and dev environments.  
  - **Document Object Model (DOM)** – Libraries for DOM manipulation and interaction.  
  - **Documentation** – Tools and generators for project documentation.  
  - **Graphics** – General graphics libraries beyond canvas-specific tools.  
  - **HTTP Handler** – Components and utilities for handling HTTP requests and responses in ClojureScript contexts.  
  - **Internationalization** – Libraries for i18n and localization support.  
  - **JavaScript Interoperability** – Tools that simplify interop between ClojureScript and JavaScript libraries or APIs.  
  - **CSS Tools** – Utilities and libraries for managing or generating CSS from ClojureScript.  
  - **Miscellaneous** – Additional ClojureScript tools and libraries that don’t fit other categories.  
  - **React.js Interface** – ClojureScript interfaces and wrappers for React.js.  
  - **Reactive Programming** – Libraries for FRP, streams, and reactive architectures.  
  - **Routing** – Client-side routing and navigation libraries.  
  - **State Management** – Tools and patterns for managing application state in ClojureScript apps.  
  - **Testing** – Testing frameworks and utilities for unit, integration, or end-to-end testing.  
  - **Validation** – Data and input validation libraries.  
  - **Web Framework & Template** – Web frameworks and templating solutions for building ClojureScript-based web apps.
