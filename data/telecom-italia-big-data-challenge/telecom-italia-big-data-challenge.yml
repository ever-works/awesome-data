  - **Brand:** Telecom Italia  
  - **Source:** [Competition / reference paper (PDF)](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstreams/c3c47fef-ca54-4b36-9e13-6e26117d2f9b/download)

  ### Overview
  The challenge is positioned as a *data collaborative*: a cross-sector initiative where a private company (Telecom Italia) shares proprietary data for public-good uses, including research, innovation, and evidence-based policy insights related to urban life and smart cities.

  ### Features
  - **Large-scale telecom datasets**  
    - Anonymized mobile network data (e.g., call records, signaling, or traffic aggregates).  
    - Suitable for studying mobility patterns, human presence, and spatial-temporal dynamics.

  - **Urban and smart city data**  
    - Datasets aligned with smart city use cases (e.g., urban planning, mobility, energy, or city services).  
    - Supports research on how people move and interact in urban environments.

  - **Open data mining competition format**  
    - Participants receive standardized datasets for analytical and modeling tasks.  
    - Focus on creating innovative, data-driven solutions for urban and societal challenges.

  - **Public-good and research orientation**  
    - Framed as a *data collaborative* or *data philanthropy* use case: private-sector data shared for societal benefit.  
    - Enables evidence-based insights for policy, planning, and smart city decision-making.

  - **Cross-sector collaboration**  
    - Involves partnerships between a telecom operator and researchers, innovators, and public-sector actors.  
    - Encourages experimentation with new forms of data sharing and use.

  ### Use Cases
  - Smart city analytics and urban innovation projects.  
  - Mobility and transportation pattern analysis.  
  - Urban planning and land-use insights.  
  - Research on data collaboratives, data philanthropy, and cross-sector data sharing models.

  ### Pricing
  No pricing or fee structure is specified in the provided content (access is typically framed as part of a research or innovation challenge rather than a commercial product plan).
