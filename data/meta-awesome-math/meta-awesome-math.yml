  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome - Math is a curated, Awesome-style subdirectory within the
  broader Meta Awesome project. It aggregates links to mathematical libraries,
  tools, and educational resources hosted across the web, with a focus on
  programming-related math material (e.g., libraries, frameworks, and learning
  resources for developers and learners).


  ## Features

  - **Awesome-style collection**
    - Follows the common "Awesome list" structure (grouped, link-based curation).
    - Hosted as a Markdown document within a GitHub repository.

  - **Mathematical libraries**
    - Includes links to math-related code libraries (e.g., for numerical computation, algebra, statistics, etc.).
    - Focuses on developer-usable resources rather than general marketing content.

  - **Tools and utilities**
    - Aggregates tools useful for mathematical work in software projects (e.g., computation engines, symbolic math tools, plotting/visualization tools), as available in the linked document.

  - **Educational resources**
    - Collects learning materials related to mathematics (tutorials, guides, reading lists, and similar resources) aimed at education and self-study.

  - **Meta-directory structure**
    - Part of the broader "Meta Awesome" directory, which organizes multiple themed Awesome-style lists.
    - The math document is specifically dedicated to math-focused content, separating it from other domains.

  ## Pricing

  - Access to the Meta Awesome - Math list is free via the public GitHub
  repository.

  - No paid plans or pricing tiers are indicated in the provided content.
