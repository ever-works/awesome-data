  ## Overview

  Dive into Machine Learning is an open, curated guide that aggregates free,
  practical resources for learning machine learning using Python and Jupyter
  Notebook. It follows an “awesome list” style, organizing notebooks, courses,
  and external links to help learners get hands-on quickly.


  ## Features

  - **Curated Learning Guide**
    - Organized as an “awesome-style” list focused specifically on practical machine learning.
    - Emphasizes modern, hands-on learning materials rather than theory-only resources.

  - **Focus on Free Resources**
    - Highlights free ways to start with machine learning.
    - Includes free notebooks, courses, and other openly available links.

  - **Python & Jupyter Notebook Oriented**
    - Assumes basic Python knowledge and guides learners toward Python-based ML.
    - Encourages use of Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation.

  - **Tooling Recommendations**
    - Suggests installing Python 3 and required packages via the Anaconda Python distribution for an easier local setup.

  - **Starter Onboarding (“Hello World” ML)**
    - Aims to get learners to a simple, hands-on machine learning “Hello World” within minutes.
    - Targets beginners who know a bit of Python and want to see practical ML examples quickly.

  - **Links to Complementary Guides**
    - Points readers to additional learning paths such as “Machine Learning for Software Engineers” by Nam Vu and other alternative ML guides.

  - **Related Project Recommendations**
    - Mentions related GitHub initiatives and lists, including:
      - `daviddao/awful-ai`
      - `humanetech-community/awesome-humane-tech`
      - Climate and sustainability–oriented repos like `ProjectDrawdown/solutions`, `philsturgeon/awesome-earth`, `daviddao/code-against-climate-change`, and `protontypes/open-sustainable-technology`.

  - **Open Source Repository**
    - Hosted on GitHub with version history and community contributions.
    - Includes a LICENSE file and configuration for GitHub Pages / site rendering via `_config.yml`.

  ## Audience

  - Learners who know a bit of Python and want to get started with machine
  learning.

  - Developers looking for a structured, curated entry point into ML using
  modern tools.

  - People interested in practical applications of ML, including ethically-aware
  and climate-related tech projects.


  ## Pricing

  - Not a paid product or service.

  - All referenced core materials are positioned as free ways to dive into
  machine learning (though some linked external resources may have their own
  terms).
