  ## Overview

  Awesome CDK is a curated, community-maintained list of open‑source projects,
  construct libraries, tools, examples, and learning materials for the AWS Cloud
  Development Kit (CDK) and related CDK-based frameworks. It helps developers
  discover reusable constructs, higher-level frameworks, and practical resources
  for building cloud infrastructure as code with CDK.


  ## Features


  ### Scope of Resources

  - Focus on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) and related CDK ecosystems.

  - Includes open-source projects, guides, blogs, talks, and other learning
  resources.

  - Emphasizes reusable CDK constructs and higher-level abstractions.


  ### Organized Content Sections

  - **Construct Libraries** – Libraries in various programming languages that
  provide CDK constructs for reuse in applications, organized by topic such as:
    - APIs
    - Databases
    - Static Websites
    - Security
    - Ops
    - Queue
    - CI/CD
    - Monitoring
    - Workflows
    - Multi-account setup
  - **High-Level Frameworks** – Frameworks built on top of CDK that provide
  opinionated patterns or application structures.

  - **Scaffolding** – Starters, templates, and generators to bootstrap new CDK
  projects.

  - **Language Support** – Resources related to using CDK in different supported
  languages.

  - **Library Publishing** – Tools and guidance for publishing CDK construct
  libraries.

  - **Tools** – CLI tools, utilities, and auxiliary software that enhance CDK
  development and operations.

  - **Training Materials and Sample Code** – Tutorials, courses, example
  repositories, and code samples for learning CDK.

  - **Blog Posts & Talks** – Curated educational content from the community and
  AWS about CDK.

  - **Related Projects** – Other projects connected to or extending CDK
  capabilities.

  - **Tips & Tricks** – Practical advice, patterns, and snippets for effective
  CDK use.


  ### Technical Details & Conventions
