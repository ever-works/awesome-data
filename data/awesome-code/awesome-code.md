## Overview
Awesome Code is a curated directory of links to notable and high-quality code implementations of various models. It focuses on collecting and organizing implementations so developers can quickly discover and explore practical, real-world code examples.

## Features
- **Curated link collection** – Focuses on “awesome” and notable implementations rather than exhaustive listings.
- **Model implementation focus** – Organizes links around implementations of models (e.g., algorithms, machine learning models, or other formal models), rather than general libraries or tools.
- **Developer-centric resource** – Serves as a reference for developers seeking concrete code examples and implementations.
- **Awesome-list style organization** – Follows the familiar pattern of GitHub awesome lists (structured, link-based, and community-oriented).

## Pricing
- Not applicable (open GitHub list / directory).
