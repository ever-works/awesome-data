  # Delve Datasets for Classification and Regression


  A collection of standardized datasets for developing, evaluating, and
  comparing machine learning methods, maintained by the University of Toronto’s
  DELVE project.


  ## Overview


  - **Type:** Dataset collection

  - **Domain:** Machine learning (classification and regression)

  - **Maintained by:** University of Toronto, DELVE project

  - **Primary use:** Benchmarking, assessment, and development of learning
  algorithms

  - **Access:** Downloadable as gzipped-tar files

  - **Recommended tooling:** Delve software environment (for maximum benefit)


  ## Features


  ### Dataset Organization

  - Datasets grouped into **categories by recommended use**:
    - **Assessment datasets** – for reporting final results; methods should be run once per task without tuning on test data.
    - **Development datasets** – (mentioned conceptually; used for method development and tuning, details not in excerpt).
    - **Historical datasets** – (mentioned conceptually as a category; details not in excerpt).
  - Within each category, datasets are further labeled as:
    - **Regression** – continuous target/prototask.
    - **Classification** – discrete target/prototask.

  ### Access & Format

  - Each dataset (or **family of datasets**) has:
    - A **brief overview page**.
    - Often **detailed documentation** (per-dataset docs pages).
  - Datasets available as **gzipped-tar archives** via FTP.

  - **Installation instructions** for downloaded datasets are provided on the
  site (installation section referenced but not expanded in the excerpt).

  - A **summary table** of all datasets is available for quick reference.


  ### Tooling Integration

  - Designed to work with the **Delve software environment**, which provides:
    - Structured access to datasets.
    - Additional utilities for evaluation (details in a separate "utils" section, not included here).

  ### Dataset Types and Examples


  #### Assessment Regression Datasets


  Intended for reporting performance; do not tune on test data.


  1. **abalone**
     - **Task:** Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements.
     - **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository.
     - **Download:** `abalone.tar.gz` (gzipped-tar archive via FTP).

  2. **bank (bank-family)**
     - **Type:** Family of synthetically generated datasets.
     - **Task domain:** Simulation of how bank customers choose their banks.
     - **Prototask:** Predict the fraction of bank customers who leave the bank because of full queues.
     - **Download:** `bank-family` (tar archive via FTP).

  3. **census-house**
     - **Task:** Predict median house prices from 1990 US census data.
     - **Download:** `census-house.tar.gz` (gzipped-tar archive via FTP).

  4. **comp-activ**
     - **Task:** Predict computer system activity from system performance measures.
     - **Download:** `comp-activ.tar.gz` (gzipped-tar archive via FTP).

  5. **pumadyn family of datasets**
     - **Type:** Family of synthetically generated datasets.
     - **Task domain:** Dynamics of a Unimation Puma 560 robot arm.
     - **Description:** Generated from a realistic simulation of the robot arm’s dynamics.
     - **Download:** `pumadyn-family` (tar archive via FTP).

  #### Assessment Classification Datasets


  1. **adult**
     - **Task:** Predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on census data.
     - **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository.
     - **Download:** `adult.tar.gz` (gzipped-tar archive via FTP).

  2. **splice**
     - **Task:** Classification on splice junction data (full description truncated in provided content, but dataset is listed as an assessment classification dataset).
     - **Download:** `splice.tar.gz` (gzipped-tar archive via FTP; link partially shown in excerpt).

  ### Documentation & Notes

  - An **important note for users with version 1.0 of the Delve software** is
  provided on a separate page.

  - Each dataset/family has its own **`desc.html`** page with additional details
  (schema, tasks, etc.).


  ## Category

  - **Directory category:** datasets

  - **Tags:** datasets, machine-learning, benchmark


  ## Pricing

  - No pricing information is mentioned in the provided content; datasets appear
  to be freely downloadable from the University of Toronto’s DELVE project site.
