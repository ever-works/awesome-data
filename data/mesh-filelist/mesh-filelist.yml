  ## Overview

  MeSH Filelist is the official distribution page for the MeSH (Medical Subject
  Headings) files published by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. MeSH is
  the controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing, organizing, and
  searching biomedical and life sciences literature, most prominently in PubMed.
  The file list page catalogs the various downloadable MeSH data files and
  formats.

  page and standard MeSH distribution practices.


  ## Features

  - **Official MeSH distribution point**  
    - Serves as the canonical source for MeSH data made available by NLM.

  - **Comprehensive file listing**  
    - Lists all MeSH data files provided by NLM (e.g., descriptor data, supplementary concept records, qualifiers, etc.).  
    - Typically organized by file type and/or format.

  - **Multiple data formats (commonly provided for MeSH)**  
    - XML distributions suitable for programmatic use and data integration.  
    - Other structured formats may be available (e.g., ASCII or similar), depending on current NLM distribution standards.

  - **Coverage of MeSH components**  
    - Descriptors (main subject headings).  
    - Qualifiers (subheadings modifying descriptors).  
    - Supplementary concept records (e.g., chemicals, drugs, and other additional concepts).  
    - Tree structures that represent the hierarchical relationships between MeSH terms.

  - **Use in information retrieval and NLP**  
    - Designed for indexing and searching biomedical literature (e.g., PubMed, MEDLINE).  
    - Widely used in text mining and natural language processing tasks for healthcare and biomedical research (e.g., concept normalization, ontology-based search, and semantic indexing).

  - **Regularly updated vocabulary**  
    - MeSH is updated annually with additions, deletions, and changes to descriptors, qualifiers, and hierarchy.  
    - The file list reflects the currently released MeSH version and may include prior-year archives.

  - **Public dataset**  
    - Distributed by a U.S. government institution; MeSH data are generally freely available for research, indexing, and integration into systems, subject to NLM terms of use.

  ## Typical Use Cases

  - Building or enhancing biomedical search engines and discovery tools.  

  - Indexing PubMed or other literature collections with standardized subject
  headings.  

  - Supporting biomedical NLP tasks (entity normalization, topic classification,
  ontology mapping).  

  - Integrating controlled vocabulary into EHR, clinical research, or knowledge
  graph systems.


  ## Pricing

  - No pricing information is listed in the available content.  

  - MeSH data distributed by NLM are typically available free of charge, subject
  to NLM’s usage policies and license terms (users should confirm on the
  official site).
