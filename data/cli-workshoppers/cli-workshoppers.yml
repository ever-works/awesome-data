  # CLI Workshoppers


  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** tutorials, CLI, developer-tools  

  **Source:** <https://github.com/therebelrobot/awesome-workshopper#readme>


  ## Overview

  CLI Workshoppers (also known as **awesome-workshopper** /
  **awesome-adventure**) is a curated list of interactive, terminal-based
  programming tutorials and workshoppers. Each entry is a command-line guided
  exercise that helps users learn specific programming concepts, tools, or
  workflows.


  The directory is maintained as a GitHub repository and is intended both as a
  catalog of existing workshoppers and a wish-list for new ones.


  ## Features


  ### General Features

  - Curated list of **terminal-based, interactive tutorials** ("workshoppers" /
  "adventures").

  - Focus on learning **programming concepts, tools, and ecosystems** via the
  command line.

  - GitHub-based directory: contributions made via **forks, pull requests, or
  issues**.

  - Can act as a **wish-list**: users can propose new workshopper ideas that are
  not yet covered.


  ### Raw Builders (Frameworks for Creating Workshoppers)

  - **Adventure** (`substack/adventure`)
    - A framework for building terminal-based "adventure" style tutorials.
  - **Workshopper** (`rvagg/workshopper`)
    - A framework for building Node.js-based interactive command-line workshops.
