  ## Description

  Awesome Audio Over IP is a curated "awesome list" of tools, protocols,
  organizations, and educational resources related to Audio over IP (AoIP) and
  AES67. It focuses on transmitting uncompressed, low-latency audio over IP
  (layer 3) networks and highlights actively maintained projects.


  ## Features

  - **Curated AoIP & AES67 focus**
    - Dedicated to Audio over IP in professional audio environments
    - Emphasis on uncompressed, low-latency audio transport over layer‑3 IP networks
    - Includes references to common AoIP protocols such as Dante, AES67, and Ravenna

  - **Actively maintained tools list**
    - Only includes projects that are currently maintained
    - Separate `awesome-but-inactive` list for older or inactive projects
    - Notes that tooling in the AoIP ecosystem is still relatively sparse, providing a focused overview of what is available

  - **Tools section**
    - Includes AoIP-relevant system tools such as:
      - `ptp4l` (Precision Time Protocol daemon, used for time synchronization in AoIP workflows)
      - `phc2sys` (synchronizes system time with a PTP hardware clock)
    - Space for both open-source and **Closed Source** tools (closed-source category present, content curated in the repository)

  - **Organizations**
    - Section dedicated to organizations relevant to AoIP and AES67 (e.g., standards bodies, ecosystem players), curated in the README.

  - **Education resources**
    - Section for educational material and references about AoIP and AES67
    - Includes links explaining AoIP concepts, such as general introductions to Audio over IP, AVB, Dante, and other protocols.

  - **Quality curation & governance**
    - Adheres to the [Awesome](https://awesome.re) list standards
    - Includes a clear **code of conduct** for community interaction
    - Provides **contribution guidelines** to standardize how new tools and resources are added
    - License file included to clarify reuse of the list

  - **Ecosystem notes & footnotes**
    - Footnotes section (in the README) giving context about selection criteria and ecosystem maturity
