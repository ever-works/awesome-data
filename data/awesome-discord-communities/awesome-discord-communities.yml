  ## Overview

  Awesome Discord Communities is a curated, open-source directory of
  high-quality Discord servers, with a particular focus on programming-related
  communities and other interest-based groups. Servers are organized by topic
  and area of interest to help users quickly find relevant communities.


  ## Features

  - **Curated Discord server list** – Focuses on high-quality Discord
  communities rather than a raw, unfiltered index.

  - **Programming-focused communities** – Emphasis on servers for programmers
  and developers.

  - **Organized by topic and interest** – Communities grouped into categories so
  users can browse by relevant subjects.

  - **Open-source repository** – Implemented as a public GitHub repository for
  transparency and community involvement.

  - **Structured data directory** – Uses a `data` folder to store community
  listings in a structured manner.

  - **Image assets** – Includes an `images` directory for banners and visual
  assets used in the listing.

  - **Contribution guidelines** – `CONTRIBUTING.md` provides rules and process
  for adding or updating communities.

  - **Code of Conduct** – `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` outlines expected behavior for
  contributors.

  - **FAQ documentation** – `FAQ.md` addresses common questions about the list
  and contributions.

  - **Automated/Scripted generation** – `main.py` and `src/template` indicate
  templated or scripted generation of the list from data files.

  - **Project metadata/configuration** – `pyproject.toml` defines Python project
  settings and dependencies for tooling/scripts.

  - **License information** – `LICENSE` file specifying legal terms for use and
  contribution.

  - **Badges and status info** – `badges.md` provides badge definitions to show
  project status/metadata.
