  ## Overview

  `awesome-github` is a curated, directory-style list of tools, tips, resources,
  and examples that highlight how GitHub is used as a powerful platform for
  collaboration and co-creation. It focuses specifically on GitHub (not Git) and
  documents projects, workflows, and practices that showcase “GitHub’s
  awesomeness.”


  ## Features

  - **Curated GitHub-focused list**  
    A maintained collection dedicated solely to GitHub-related tools, workflows, and resources, separate from general Git or version control topics.

  - **Directory-style organization**  
    Content is grouped into a small number of “buckets” (categories) to make it easier to discover types of GitHub awesomeness, such as tools, integrations, examples, and reading material.

  - **Focus on collaboration use cases**  
    Highlights how GitHub is used as a co-creation and mass-collaboration platform, beyond just hosting code repositories.

  - **Community contributions**  
    Open to contributions via pull requests, with documented [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/phillipadsmith/awesome-github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) that explain how to propose additions or changes.

  - **Further reading collection**  
    A dedicated `FURTHER_READING.md` file gathers additional articles and references for deeper exploration of GitHub practices and concepts.

  - **Open source licensing**  
    Includes a `LICENSE` file defining reuse and contribution terms, allowing others to share and build on the list.

  - **Build and quality checks**  
    A `.travis.yml` configuration enables automated Travis CI builds, typically used to validate the list’s structure or links.

  - **Part of the broader Awesome ecosystem**  
    Listed as an “Awesome” list in the style of sindresorhus/awesome, following common conventions (badge, curation style, and contribution model).

  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. This is a free, open-source GitHub repository and curated
  list with no paid plans.
