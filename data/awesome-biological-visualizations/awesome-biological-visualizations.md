## Features

### Scope & Purpose
- Collects web-based, interactive visualization tools for biological data.
- Targets scientists and developers working with human and model organism data.
- Emphasizes tools that help explore, interpret, and present complex omics and biomedical datasets in the browser.

### Thematic Organization
Tools are grouped into biologically relevant domains, making it easier to find visualizations by data type or application area:

- **Cancer**  
  Interactive visualization and analysis of cancer genomics and clinical data, including:
  - Browsing cancer mutations by tissue and histology (e.g., COSMIC Cancer Browser).
  - Exploring functional genomic datasets and correlations between genomic and phenotypic variables (e.g., UCSC Xena).
  - Visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics datasets (e.g., cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics).
  - Interactive exploration of mutation rates, mutational signatures, clinical data, and gene mutations (e.g., iCoMut Beta for FireBrowse, ExploSig).
  - Visualization and collaborative annotation of genomic aberrations (e.g., MAGI).
  - Interactive visual exploration of patient characteristics such as gender, race, and age in TCGA (e.g., Race, Gender, and Age in TCGA).
  - Omics-based clinical phenotype prediction and related analysis (e.g., OASISPRO).
  - Visualization of mutational signatures from cancer samples and cell-based experiments (e.g., Signal).
  - Integrated suites for exploring hypotheses involving molecular and clinical cancer data (e.g., Oncoscape).

- **Genomics**  
  Web tools to visualize and analyze genome-scale data, including:
  - Interactive genome browsers for a wide range of organisms (e.g., UCSC Genome Browser, Ensembl).
  - Multi-species gene-gene network analysis in a functional context (e.g., IMP: Integrative Multi-species Prediction).
  - Graph-based reconstruction of plasmids from next-generation sequencing data (e.g., PLACNETw).
  - Phylogenetic tree viewing, analysis, and editing (e.g., PhyD3, Archaeopteryx).
  - Gene function prediction based on interaction networks (e.g., GeneMANIA).
  - Visualization of variants in the human genome (e.g., Mutaframe).

- **Additional categories defined in the list** (tools enumerated in the full repository):
  - 3D Genomics
  - Metagenomics
  - Epigenomics
  - Proteomics
  - Spatial transcriptomics
  - (Non-spatial) Transcriptomics
  - Microscopy
  - Connectomics
  - Metabolomics
  - Mass Spectrometry
  - Populations
  - Medicine

Each category contains links and one-line descriptions of relevant visualization tools.

### Format & Usage
- Provided as a GitHub-hosted markdown list.
- Each entry includes:
  - Tool name (linked to the live app or project page).
  - Brief, functional description of what can be visualized or analyzed.
- Suitable as a starting point for:
  - Selecting tools for exploratory analysis of biological datasets.
  - Discovering examples and libraries for building custom web-based visualizations.
  - Teaching or documentation resources on biological data visualization.
