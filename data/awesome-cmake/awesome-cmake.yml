  ## Features

    Collects notable CMake-related content in a single place: scripts, modules, examples, and other learning or reference materials.

  - **Focus on modern CMake practices**  
    Highlights resources that follow modern CMake patterns, especially `target_*`-based dependency management.

  - **Separate "Non-Modern" section**  
    Includes an additional document, `NonModernCMake.md`, listing other useful links that rely on older or obsolete CMake practices (e.g., non–`target_*` dependency handling), clearly separated so users can prefer modern approaches.

  - **Community-driven contributions**  
    Open to contributions via GitHub, with guidelines provided in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to maintain quality and consistency.

  - **Open licensing**  
    Includes a `LICENSE` file in the repository specifying reuse and contribution terms.
