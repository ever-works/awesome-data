## Overview
Cytodata is a community and resource hub focused on **image-based profiling** of **biological phenotypes**, typically induced by genetic or chemical perturbations (often related to disease states). Image-based profiling is used to inspect phenotypic changes to uncover biological insights, such as:
- Effects of genetic alterations
- Mechanisms of action of chemical compounds

Awesome Cytodata is a curated list that aggregates software and related resources used in this domain.
