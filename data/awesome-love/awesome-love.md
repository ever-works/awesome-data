## Overview
Awesome LÖVE is a community-maintained, categorized collection of high-quality libraries, projects, and resources for the LÖVE (love2d) 2D game framework. It helps developers find tools for graphics, AI, animation, physics, UI, development utilities, and more within the LÖVE ecosystem.

## Features

### General
- Curated, community-driven list focused on LÖVE (love2d).

- **Camera** – Camera and viewport utilities (as indicated in contents list).
- **Development** – Tools and helpers for the development workflow.
- **Drawing** – Drawing and rendering helpers.
- **Entity** – Entity and game-object management solutions.
- **Helpers** – General-purpose helper utilities for LÖVE projects.
- **Input** – Input handling and mapping utilities.
- **Lighting** – Lighting and shadow libraries.
- **Math** – Math helpers and vector libraries.
- **Music** – Music and audio-related helpers.
- **Networking** – Networking and online/multiplayer utilities.
- **OO** – Object-oriented programming helpers.
- **Performance** – Profiling and optimization tools.
- **Physics** – Physics utilities and extensions.
- **Platforms** – Platform-related tools and integrations.
- **Publishing** – Packaging and release helpers for LÖVE games.
- **Serialization** – Data serialization and persistence helpers.
- **Shaders** – Shader collections and helpers.
- **Testing** – Testing and QA-related tools.
- **Tweening** – Tweening and interpolation libraries.
- **UI** – User interface frameworks and widgets.
- **Utilities** – Miscellaneous utility libraries.
- **Tutorials** – Learning resources and guides.
- **IDEs** – Editor and IDE integrations.
- **Distribution** – Distribution-related tools.
- **Related** – Other LÖVE-adjacent or relevant resources.
