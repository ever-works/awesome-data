  ## Description

  Awesome Data - Biology Datasets (Meta) is a curated, Awesome-style collection
  of biological and genomics datasets. It aggregates links to well-known biology
  resources (such as ENCODE, Ensembl, GEO, KEGG, and others) and ties each
  dataset entry to a corresponding YAML metadata file in the
  `awesomedata/apd-core` GitHub repository. This makes it part of a broader
  meta-collection of structured Awesome data directories.


  ## Features

  - **Curated biology and genomics datasets**
    - Focus on biological, genomic, and related life-science data resources.
    - Includes major community datasets such as:
      - ENCODE
      - EMPIAR
      - Ensembl Genomes
      - GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)
      - Gene Ontology
      - GloBI
      - LINCS
      - HGDP
      - HMP
      - ICOS PSP Benchmark
      - HapMap
      - JCB DataViewer (via BioStudies)
      - KEGG

  - **Awesome-style directory format**
    - Organized as a curated “Awesome list” for easy exploration.
    - Each entry provides a direct link to the primary external dataset resource.

  - **Meta collection with structured metadata**
    - Each dataset entry is paired with a YAML metadata file.
    - Metadata files are stored in the `awesomedata/apd-core` GitHub repository.
    - Designed to integrate into a larger meta-directory of Awesome data collections.

  - **Git-based, open repository**
    - Hosted on GitHub, allowing browsing, forking, and contributions via standard Git workflows.
    - Can be programmatically consumed or integrated into other tools using the YAML metadata.

  ## Pricing
