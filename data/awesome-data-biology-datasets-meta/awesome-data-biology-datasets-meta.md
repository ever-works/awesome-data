## Description
Awesome Data - Biology Datasets (Meta) is a curated, Awesome-style collection of biological and genomics datasets. It aggregates links to well-known biology resources (such as ENCODE, Ensembl, GEO, KEGG, and others) and ties each dataset entry to a corresponding YAML metadata file in the `awesomedata/apd-core` GitHub repository. This makes it part of a broader meta-collection of structured Awesome data directories.

## Features
- **Curated biology and genomics datasets**
  - Focus on biological, genomic, and related life-science data resources.
  - Includes major community datasets such as:
    - ENCODE
    - EMPIAR
    - Ensembl Genomes
    - GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)
    - Gene Ontology
    - GloBI
    - LINCS
    - HGDP
    - HMP
    - ICOS PSP Benchmark
    - HapMap
    - JCB DataViewer (via BioStudies)
    - KEGG

- **Awesome-style directory format**
  - Organized as a curated “Awesome list” for easy exploration.
  - Each entry provides a direct link to the primary external dataset resource.

- **Meta collection with structured metadata**
  - Each dataset entry is paired with a YAML metadata file.
  - Metadata files are stored in the `awesomedata/apd-core` GitHub repository.
  - Designed to integrate into a larger meta-directory of Awesome data collections.

- **Git-based, open repository**
  - Hosted on GitHub, allowing browsing, forking, and contributions via standard Git workflows.
  - Can be programmatically consumed or integrated into other tools using the YAML metadata.
