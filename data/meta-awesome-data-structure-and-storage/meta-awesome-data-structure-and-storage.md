## Overview
Meta Awesome – Data Structure and Storage is a curated meta-collection within the broader Meta Awesome project. It functions as a high-level index that aggregates and links to multiple “awesome-style” lists focused on data structures, storage technologies, and adjacent areas in data and systems engineering.

## Features
- **Meta-directory of awesome lists**
  - Aggregates many separate awesome-style lists into one centralized document.
  - Provides direct links to specialized resources maintained in other repositories.

- **Focus on data structures and storage**
  - Highlights lists related to data structures and storage systems.
  - Covers technologies and concepts used in designing and implementing data storage solutions.

- **Coverage of adjacent engineering domains**
  - Includes related awesome lists for:
    - Databases
    - Data visualization
    - Debugging
    - Deployment
    - Other data and systems engineering topics

- **High-level navigation layer**
  - Acts as an entry point for discovering deeper, topic-specific lists.
  - Organizes links in a way that helps users quickly find relevant subdomains within data and storage.

- **Curated and structured content**
  - Emphasizes quality by indexing existing community-curated awesome lists.
  - Reduces duplication by referencing specialized lists rather than recreating them.

## Use Cases
- Starting point for exploring tools, libraries, and resources across the data stack.
- Reference hub for engineers working in data structures, storage, or broader data/systems engineering.
- Quick navigation to topic-specific awesome lists without needing to search for each list individually.
