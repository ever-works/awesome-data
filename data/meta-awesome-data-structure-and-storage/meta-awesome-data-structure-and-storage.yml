  # Meta Awesome – Data Structure and Storage

  **Category:** Meta Directories  
  **Brand:** meta-awesome  
  **Website:** <https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/data-structure-and-storage.md>

  ## Overview
  Meta Awesome – Data Structure and Storage is a curated meta-collection within the broader Meta Awesome project. It functions as a high-level index that aggregates and links to multiple “awesome-style” lists focused on data structures, storage technologies, and adjacent areas in data and systems engineering.

  ## Features
  - **Meta-directory of awesome lists**
    - Aggregates many separate awesome-style lists into one centralized document.
    - Provides direct links to specialized resources maintained in other repositories.

  - **Focus on data structures and storage**
    - Highlights lists related to data structures and storage systems.
    - Covers technologies and concepts used in designing and implementing data storage solutions.

  - **Coverage of adjacent engineering domains**
    - Includes related awesome lists for:
      - Databases
      - Data visualization
      - Debugging
      - Deployment
      - Other data and systems engineering topics

  - **High-level navigation layer**
    - Acts as an entry point for discovering deeper, topic-specific lists.
    - Organizes links in a way that helps users quickly find relevant subdomains within data and storage.

  - **Curated and structured content**
    - Emphasizes quality by indexing existing community-curated awesome lists.
    - Reduces duplication by referencing specialized lists rather than recreating them.

  ## Use Cases
  - Starting point for exploring tools, libraries, and resources across the data stack.
  - Reference hub for engineers working in data structures, storage, or broader data/systems engineering.
  - Quick navigation to topic-specific awesome lists without needing to search for each list individually.

  ## Pricing
  - Not applicable (GitHub-based, open directory of links; no pricing information provided).
