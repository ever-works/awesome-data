  # Massive Visual Memory Stimuli

  ## Description

  The Massive Visual Memory Stimuli set is a compilation of image collections
  used in several influential visual memory and perception studies. It contains
  multiple subsets of images (objects, scenes, and systematically varied image
  pairs) that support experiments on recognition memory, category
  representation, and visual detail retention.


  The stimuli are organized according to the original published experiments and
  are suitable for psychological, neuroscientific, and computer vision research.

  ## Features


  ### Overall dataset characteristics

  - Large-scale image set for visual memory experiments

  - Includes objects, object categories, scenes, and systematically varied image
  pairs

  - Derived from and organized by multiple peer-reviewed studies

  - Designed for controlled experiments on recognition, categorization, and
  memory specificity

  - Images include both individual exemplars and category-level montages


  ### Subsets from Brady et al. 2008 (PNAS)

  1. **Unique Objects**
     - Individual object images with high item-level variability
     - Suitable for studying memory for distinct, non-repeated objects

  2. **State Pairs**
     - Pairs of images showing the same object in different states (e.g., open/closed, full/empty)
     - Enables experiments on memory for object state or transformation

  3. **Exemplar Pairs**
     - Pairs of images showing different exemplars of the same object category
     - Supports research on category-level memory versus item-specific memory

  ### Subset from Konkle et al. 2010 (JEP: General)

  4. **Object Categories**
     - Images organized into object categories
     - Includes category-level image arrays (e.g., multiple items of the same type arranged together)
     - Useful for studying category representation, typicality, and capacity for object category memory

  ### Subset from Konkle, Brady et al. 2010 (Psychological Science)

  5. **Scene Categories**
     - Collections of scene images grouped into categories (e.g., airports, barns)
     - Includes multi-image scene montages per category
     - Suitable for work on scene memory, context, and high-level visual representation

  ### Subsets from Brady et al. 2012 (JEP: General)

  6. **State × Exemplar Pairs**
     - Stimuli that combine object state differences with exemplar differences
     - Allows fine-grained tests of how memory encodes both which exemplar and which state

  7. **State × Color Pairs**
     - Pairs varying in object state and color properties
     - Supports experiments on sensitivity to color and state information in memory

  ### Example content types (from thumbnails shown)

  - Individual object images (e.g., tools, household items, toys)

  - Object arrays (e.g., all abacus images, all airplane images)

  - Scene arrays (e.g., multiple airports or barns per scene category)

  - Small thumbnails/“-s” versions for quick browsing or reduced-size display

  ## Use Cases

  - Visual recognition and memory experiments

  - Research on capacity and fidelity of long-term visual memory

  - Studies of object and scene categorization

  - Benchmarking and stimulus construction for cognitive and neuroscience
  experiments

  - Potential use as a structured image set for certain computer vision and
  representation-learning tasks
