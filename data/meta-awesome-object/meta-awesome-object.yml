  ## Meta Awesome – Object


  **Website:**
  https://github.com/jepemo/meta-awesome/blob/master/doc/object.md  

  **Category:** Meta-directories  

  **Tags:** meta-directory, programming, awesome-lists


  ### Overview

  Meta Awesome – Object is a curated meta-category within the broader
  *meta-awesome* project. It indexes and organizes “awesome” style lists that
  focus on object abstractions in programming and related development resources.


  ### Features

  - **Meta directory of object-focused lists**  
    Aggregates multiple “awesome” lists related to object abstractions, object models, and object-oriented concepts.

  - **Programming-oriented scope**  
    Targets software developers and researchers interested in object abstraction patterns, libraries, frameworks, and conceptual resources.

  - **GitHub-based curation**  
    Maintained as a Markdown document in a GitHub repository, making it easy to browse, clone, and contribute via standard Git workflows.

  - **Part of the `meta-awesome` collection**  
    Integrated into a larger ecosystem of meta-awesome categories, each organizing awesome lists by topic, with this document dedicated specifically to object abstractions.

  - **Link-out structure**  
    Functions primarily as an index: entries point to external awesome lists and resources rather than hosting content directly.

  ### Content Types Indexed

  - Awesome lists on object abstractions and object-oriented design

  - Programming resources related to object models and patterns

  - Related tooling and libraries as referenced by the linked awesome lists


  ### Pricing

  - Access is free and open-source (standard public GitHub repository usage).
