  ## Overview


  Awesome Bitcoin Payment Processors is a community-maintained list that
  catalogs different types of Bitcoin payment processors. It focuses on tools
  that help you accept Bitcoin (and in some cases Lightning) payments, either
  via self-hosted software or third‑party services.


  The repository is structured as an "awesome list" and links out to individual
  projects, rather than providing its own processing service.
