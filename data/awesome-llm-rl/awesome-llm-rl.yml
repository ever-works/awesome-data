  ## Overview

  Awesome LLM RL is an "awesome-style" curated directory focused on
  reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). It aggregates
  open-source projects, tools, frameworks, and educational resources relevant to
  RL for LLMs, functioning as a specialized hub within the broader AI and LLM
  ecosystem.


  ## Features

  - **Curated reinforcement learning + LLM focus**
    - Specifically targets reinforcement learning methods and applications involving large language models.
    - Acts as a niche directory within the wider AI/ML and LLM tooling landscape.

  - **Open-source project directory**
    - Catalogs open-source frameworks and libraries for RL with LLMs.
    - Includes projects built on popular ecosystems such as:
      - Ray
      - vLLM
      - ZeRO-3
      - HuggingFace Transformers

  - **Learning and research resources**
    - Lists learning materials and resources for understanding and applying RL to LLMs (e.g., docs, examples, and guides within the repository and linked resources).

  - **Structured documentation**
    - Repository includes dedicated documentation folders and topic-specific markdown files (e.g., `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`) to organize content by tools, agents, or model families.

  - **Awesome list compliant**
    - Follows the community conventions for "awesome" lists (badged and indexed on awesome.re).
    - Licensed under **CC BY 4.0**, allowing sharing and adaptation with attribution.

  - **Web version of the list**
