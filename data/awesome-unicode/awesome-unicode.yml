  ## Overview

  Awesome Unicode is a curated list of Unicode-related knowledge, tools, and
  learning resources. It collects background material on the Unicode standard,
  demonstrations of Unicode behavior and quirks, libraries and packages for
  working with Unicode, and further reading for developers and learners.


  ## Features


  ### Educational Background

  - Quick background on Unicode and its purpose in unifying character
  representation across languages and scripts.

  - Explanation of what kinds of characters the Unicode standard includes
  (modern, ancient, undeciphered, symbols, emojis, etc.).

  - Overview of Unicode character encodings and how they differ.

  - Discussion of numeric aspects of Unicode (code points, ranges, planes).

  - Explanation of UTF-16 surrogate pairs:
    - What surrogate pairs are.
    - How and why they are used.
  - Step‑by‑step coverage of calculating surrogate pairs.

  - Coverage of composing and decomposing characters (combining marks,
  normalization concepts).

  - Section on myths and common misconceptions about Unicode.

  - Applied Unicode encodings section showing how encodings are used in
  practice.

  - Source code examples referenced for practical understanding.


  ### Awesome Characters List

  - Collection of interesting / special Unicode characters.

  - Special characters section highlighting unusual or notable code points.

  - Examples showing that variable identifiers can effectively include
  whitespace-like characters.

  - Modifier characters and their effects.

  - Uppercase transformation collisions (cases where different characters map to
  the same uppercase form).

  - Lowercase transformation collisions (cases where different characters map to
  the same lowercase form).


  ### Quirks and Troubleshooting

  - Discussion of real-world quirks you may encounter when using Unicode.

  - One-to-many case mappings and how they affect text processing and
  normalization.


  ### Packages & Libraries

  - Curated list of “awesome” packages and libraries for working with Unicode:
    - Tools and libraries for encoding/decoding.
    - Utilities for normalization and text transformation.
    - Programmatic access to Unicode data.

  ### Emojis

  - Section dedicated to emoji within Unicode.

  - Coverage of diversity in emoji (e.g., skin tones, variants, and related
  encoding details).


  ### Creative Coding Uses

  - Ideas and examples for creatively naming variables and methods using
  Unicode.

  - Recursive HTML tag renaming script demonstrating Unicode use in tooling and
  code transformation.


  ### Fonts and Display

  - Unicode fonts section listing or referencing fonts with broad Unicode
  coverage.


  ### Further Exploration

  - “More Reading” section with deeper articles, specifications, and references
  about Unicode.

  - “Exploring Deeper into Unicode Yourself” with guidance and resources for
  hands-on exploration.


  ### Visual Aids and Maps

  - Overview map section for visualizing Unicode structure.

  - A map of the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).

  - Unicode blocks overview to understand how characters are grouped.


  ## Notes

  - Contribution guidelines and a glossary of Unicode terminology are provided
  in the repository for those who want to contribute or understand key terms.


  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable. Awesome Unicode is an open, curated list hosted on GitHub
  and does not list pricing or paid plans.
