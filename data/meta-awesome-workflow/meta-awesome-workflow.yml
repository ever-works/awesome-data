  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – Workflow is a curated “meta awesome” index that aggregates and
  organizes multiple *awesome lists* and resources focused on workflows,
  automation, and process management tools. It acts as a directory of
  workflow-related collections rather than a single tool or service.


  ## Features

  - **Meta index of workflow resources**  
    - Collects and links to various *awesome* lists dedicated to workflows, automation, and process management.  
    - Helps users discover specialized collections instead of searching for each list individually.

  - **Coverage of workflow and automation tooling**  
    - Includes resources for developer workflows (e.g., CI/CD, issue tracking, code review, automation).  
    - Surfaces tools and lists related to scheduling, process orchestration, and automation pipelines.

  - **Process management focus**  
    - Emphasizes tools and libraries that support structured workflows and business or developer processes.  
    - Useful for building, documenting, and improving repeatable processes.

  - **Productivity-oriented collections**  
    - Tags and resources aligned with productivity, workflow optimization, and reducing manual work.  
    - Aids in finding tools for both individual and team productivity enhancements.

  - **Part of the Meta Awesome ecosystem**  
    - Follows the broader *meta-awesome* convention of aggregating multiple awesome lists under a single thematic index.  
    - Benefits from community-maintained GitHub lists and contributions.

  ## Use Cases

  - Quickly finding awesome lists about workflow engines and orchestration
  frameworks.  

  - Discovering automation tools for software development workflows (CI/CD,
  issue tracking, code review, etc.).  

  - Exploring resources for process management and productivity improvement.  

  - Building curated collections of workflow tools for teams or organizations.


  ## Pricing

  Meta Awesome – Workflow is a curated GitHub-based index of open resources and
  does not present any pricing or paid plans. It is generally available as a
  free, community-maintained resource.
