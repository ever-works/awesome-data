## Overview
EveryPolitician is an open data project that collates and publishes structured information about politicians around the world as reusable datasets. It focuses on making political person data transparent, well-documented, and broadly usable for analysis, compliance, and civic technology.

## Features
- **Global political person coverage**  
  - Structured data on politicians and politically exposed persons (PEPs) across many countries and territories.  
  - Emphasis on national-level positions with significant public influence.

- **Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) focus**  
  - Uses the financial-services definition of PEPs (prominent public function: cabinet members, parliamentarians, senior public servants, senior military officers, and managers of state-owned enterprises).  
  - Distinguishes clearly that being a PEP does not imply wrongdoing; instead, it relates to enhanced due‑diligence requirements in financial crime regulation.  
  - Designed to support enhanced scrutiny, KYC/AML workflows, and risk assessment where identification of PEPs is required.

- **Transparent methodology**  
  - Public documentation of methodology for defining which positions count as PEP roles on a country‑by‑country basis.  
  - Mapping of political positions to create reproducible, auditable coverage criteria.  
  - Quality metrics for coverage across:
    - Time (historical and current positions)
    - Jurisdiction (different countries and territories)
    - Level of government (e.g., national; other levels where defined in the methodology).

- **Automated data collection**  
  - Focus on automation instead of manual tracking of political events and elections.  
  - Scalable approach intended to increase and maintain coverage over time.  
  - Reduces reliance on ad‑hoc updates tied to specific political events.

- **Integration with community data ecosystems**  
  - Explicit aim to expand the representation of political figures in community-driven resources such as Wikidata.  
  - Treats PEP and politician information as a commodity dataset that can be collaboratively maintained and reused.

- **Country-by-country PEP datasets**  
  - Per‑country pages listing:
    - Number of positions defined as PEP-relevant.  
    - Number of individuals classified as PEPs.  
  - Coverage examples (as shown in the content snippet):
    - Eastern Africa (e.g., Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, etc.)
    - Middle Africa (e.g., Angola, Cameroon, DR Congo, Gabon, etc.)
    - Territories and special regions (e.g., British Indian Ocean Territory, French Southern Territories, Mayotte, Réunion, Somaliland, Zaire as a historical entity).  
  - Supports navigation by region (Eastern Africa, Middle Africa, Northern Africa, etc.) and then by country.

- **Position and person breakdown**  
  - Separate views/definitions for:
    - **Positions**: political offices and roles considered PEP-relevant.  
    - **PEPs**: persons occupying these positions.  
  - Enables analysis at both office/role level and individual level.

## Data & Usage Notes
- Suitable for:
  - Compliance and financial crime prevention teams needing structured PEP references.  
  - Researchers and journalists analyzing political networks and office-holders.  
  - Civic tech projects that require machine-readable lists of politicians.  
- Emphasis on openness and reusability, with data organized as standardized datasets.
