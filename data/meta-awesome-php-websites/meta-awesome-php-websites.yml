  ## Overview

  Meta Awesome – PHP Websites is a curated meta-collection of “Awesome-style”
  lists that focus specifically on PHP-related websites and online resources. It
  aggregates links to independently maintained Awesome lists and similar
  collections that cover PHP frameworks, learning portals, documentation hubs,
  and other PHP-focused web resources.


  ## Features

  - **Meta-directory of PHP lists**
    - Collects and organizes links to multiple Awesome-style lists centered on PHP.
    - Acts as a starting point to discover specialized PHP resource lists maintained across GitHub.

      - Framework homepages and documentation sites.
      - Learning portals and tutorial hubs.
      - Reference and documentation websites.
      - Community portals and aggregators around PHP development.

  - **Curated, Awesome-style format**
    - Follows the “Awesome” list convention used widely on GitHub (markdown lists, concise descriptions, external links).
    - Leverages community-maintained lists, keeping the content decentralized but discoverable in one place.

  - **GitHub-hosted documentation**
    - Provided as a markdown document within the `meta-awesome` GitHub repository.
    - Benefits from version control, issue tracking, and community contributions through pull requests.

  - **Taggable and searchable**
    - Associated with tags like `awesome-lists`, `meta-directory`, and `php`, making it easy to locate via GitHub search or external directory indexing.

  ## Use Cases

  - Quickly discover high-quality Awesome lists about PHP tools, frameworks, and
  learning resources.

  or onboarding materials.

  tutorials) via curated external lists.
