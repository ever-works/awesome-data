  # Awesome SQLAlchemy


  **Website:** https://github.com/dahlia/awesome-sqlalchemy#readme  

  **Category:** Themed Directories  

  **Tags:** Python, Database, ORM


  ## Overview

  Awesome SQLAlchemy is a curated, community-maintained directory of libraries,
  extensions, utilities, and learning resources built around SQLAlchemy,
  Python’s SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper. The list is inspired by the
  wider "awesome-*" ecosystem and is licensed under Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0.


  ## Features


  ### General

  - Curated collection of third‑party tools and resources for SQLAlchemy.

  - Organized by topic (e.g., data structures, types, migrations, profiling,
  GIS, etc.).

  - Includes links out to official SQLAlchemy documentation and related
  ecosystems.

  - Openly licensed content (CC BY-SA 4.0) for reuse and adaptation.


  ### Data Structures

  - Versioning and auditing extensions for SQLAlchemy models (e.g., tracking
  changes to rows over time, audit history).


  ### Data Types & Utilities

  - Support and examples for using standard Python types like `enum.Enum` and
  `datetime.datetime` with SQLAlchemy.

  - Various utility functions, new column types, and helpers that extend
  SQLAlchemy’s built‑in type system.


  ### Database Migration Tools

  - Section dedicated to tools that handle schema migrations for
  SQLAlchemy-backed databases (e.g., versioned DDL changes,
  upgrades/downgrades).


  ### Dialects

  - References to SQLAlchemy’s official dialect documentation for working with
  different database backends.

  - Helps users find dialect-specific configuration and usage notes (e.g.,
  PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, etc.).


  ### Documentation

  - Links to documentation resources related to SQLAlchemy and its ecosystem
  (tutorials, guides, references).


  ### File and Image Attachments

  - Section for libraries that integrate file or image attachment handling with
  SQLAlchemy models (e.g., storing metadata, paths, or references in the
  database).


  ### Forms and Data Validation

  - Tools that connect SQLAlchemy models with schema/validation libraries.

  - **ColanderAlchemy**:
    - Auto-generates Colander schemas from SQLAlchemy mapped classes.
    - Enables reuse of model definitions as validation schemas.
    - Integrates with Deform for building forms based on these schemas.
    - Reduces duplication between database model definitions and validation schemas.

  ### Full-text Searching

  - Section for libraries that provide full-text search capabilities on top of
  SQLAlchemy models (e.g., search indexing and querying helpers).


  ### GIS and Spatial Databases

  - **GeoAlchemy**:
    - Provides extensions to work with spatial databases via SQLAlchemy.
    - Supports PostGIS, Spatialite, MySQL, Oracle, and MS SQL Server 2008.
  - **GeoAlchemy 2**:
    - Extensions for spatial databases with a focus on PostGIS.
    - Supports PostGIS 1.5 and 2.x.
    - Supports Spatialite with some additional configuration on the application side.
    - Designed to be simpler to use and maintain than the original GeoAlchemy.

  ### Internationalization

  - Internationalization extensions for SQLAlchemy models (e.g., handling
  translated fields, locale-specific content).


  ### Profiling and Performance Analysis

  - **SQLTap**:
    - Profiles and introspects SQL queries executed via SQLAlchemy.
    - Helps analyze query performance characteristics.
  - **nplusone**:
    - Auto-detects N+1 query patterns in applications using SQLAlchemy or other Python ORMs.
    - Identifies unnecessary queries caused by lazy loading or inefficient eager loading.
