  ## Overview
  meta-awesome: Forms and Templates is a curated meta-index of “awesome lists” focused on web forms, templating systems, and view-layer tools. Instead of being a single list of libraries, it aggregates and links to many specialist awesome lists and collections in this domain.

  ## Features
  - **Meta index of awesome lists**
    - Acts as a directory-of-directories specifically for forms and templating topics.
    - Links out to multiple independently maintained awesome lists.

  - **Focus on forms**
    - Collects resources and awesome lists about form handling in web applications.
    - Includes tools, libraries, and patterns related to building, validating, and processing forms.

  - **Focus on templating systems**
    - Aggregates awesome lists covering HTML/template engines and view-layer rendering tools.
    - Relevant for server-side and client-side rendering stacks.

  - **View-layer tooling coverage**
    - Emphasizes tools that sit in the view layer of web applications (e.g., UI templating, dynamic rendering helpers).

  - **Developer-oriented curation**
    - Organized for web developers looking to compare or discover form and template ecosystems.
    - Uses the common “awesome list” style: community-driven, GitHub-hosted collections.

  - **Part of the broader meta-awesome project**
    - This document is one section within the larger `meta-awesome` repository, which indexes awesome lists across many domains.

  ## Pricing
  - Not applicable. This is a free, open, GitHub-hosted meta index of links to public awesome lists.
