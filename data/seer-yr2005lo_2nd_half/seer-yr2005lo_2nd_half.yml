  ## SEER-YR2005.LO_2ND_HALF

  July–December 2005 Louisiana cancer diagnoses, extracted as a special subset of the SEER November 2017 research submission and cataloged in Awesome Public Datasets. Intended for focused regional and temporal analyses, including prostate and other cancer sites.

  ### Overview
  - **Type:** Cancer incidence research dataset (SEER subset)
  - **Time period covered:** July–December 2005 (2nd half of 2005)
  - **Region:** Louisiana (Hurricane Katrina–impacted registry)
  - **Parent release:** SEER*Stat Databases – SEER November 2017 Submission
  - **Primary use cases:**
    - Regional cancer epidemiology (Louisiana-specific)
    - Temporal analysis of mid-2005 incidence
    - Registry- or disaster-specific analyses (e.g., Katrina-related context)
    - Site-specific studies, including prostate cancer

  ### Features
  - **Focused temporal subset**
    - Records restricted to diagnoses from July–December 2005.
    - Useful for mid-year temporal snapshots or pre-/post-event comparisons within 2005.

  - **Regional specificity: Louisiana**
    - Data derived from the Louisiana cancer registry within SEER.
    - Relevant to studies of cancer incidence in a Hurricane Katrina–impacted state.

  - **Cancer incidence content**
    - Includes multiple cancer sites, explicitly mentioned to include **prostate cancer** cases.
    - Designed for incidence-focused work; can be integrated with broader SEER incidence databases (e.g., SEER 18 with Hurricane Katrina–impacted Louisiana cases).

  - **Alignment with SEER Nov 2017 SEER*Stat databases**
    - Compatible with SEER*Stat sessions described for the Nov 2017 submission (Rate, Prevalence, Survival, Case Listing, MP-SIR, etc.).
    - Uses the standard SEER November 2017 variable definitions and encodings.
    - Variables are documented in the SEER*Stat variable dictionary (field numbers, NAACCR codes, definitions).

  - **Hurricane Katrina / Rita context**
    - Falls within the time window where **Katrina/Rita population adjustments** are relevant in the SEER November 2017 databases.
    - Suitable for analyses that need to consider population adjustments or disaster-related registry impacts, especially for Louisiana.

  - **Research-oriented structure**
    - Designed for use with SEER*Stat software for:
      - Rate and prevalence analyses
      - Survival and left-truncated life table analyses
      - Case listing and frequency analyses
      - MP-SIR/SMR-type analyses (when integrated with appropriate SEER datasets)
