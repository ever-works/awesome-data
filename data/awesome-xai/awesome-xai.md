## Overview
Awesome XAI is a curated, open-source list of explainable AI (XAI) and interpretable machine learning (ML) resources. It aggregates key papers, methods, critiques, and related materials that help make machine learning models more understandable.

Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on techniques and models that provide insight into how ML systems work and why they make particular predictions.

## Features
- **Curated XAI & Interpretable ML focus**  
  - Dedicated to explainable AI and interpretable machine learning topics.  
  - Emphasis on both practical methods and theoretical foundations.

- **Organized papers collection**  
  - **Landmark papers:** Foundational and influential works in XAI and interpretability, highlighted as especially worth reading in full.  
  - **Survey papers:** Overviews and literature reviews of XAI and interpretable ML research.  
  - **Evaluation papers:** Works focused on assessing and benchmarking XAI methods.  
  - **XAI methods:** Papers describing methods and algorithms for explaining model behavior.  
  - **Interpretable models:** Research on inherently interpretable model classes and architectures.  
  - **Critiques:** Critical perspectives on XAI, its assumptions, limitations, and methodology.

- **Related repositories**  
  - Section listing GitHub repositories relevant to XAI and interpretable ML (e.g., code for methods, libraries, or frameworks).

- **Video resources**  
  - Collection of talks, lectures, or presentations related to explainable AI and interpretability.

- **People & accounts to follow**  
  - “Follow” section highlighting individuals or organizations working in XAI and interpretable ML (with note that their views are their own).

- **Community contribution model**  
  - Public contribution guidelines (`contributing.md`) for adding or updating resources.  
  - Open to “contributions of any kind” as long as guidelines are followed.  
  - Contributor list acknowledging those who have contributed to the list.

- **Project governance & meta**  
  - Code of conduct to guide community interactions.  
  - Open-source license.
