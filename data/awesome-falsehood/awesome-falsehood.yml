  # awesome-falsehood


  A curated directory of documented “falsehoods” programmers commonly believe
  about real‑world domains (such as time, names, and geography), with references
  and explanations.

  ## Overview

  awesome-falsehood is an open, community-maintained list that catalogs
  incorrect assumptions developers often make when modeling real-world concepts
  in software. Each entry typically points to articles, standards, or
  discussions that explain why the assumption is wrong and how to design systems
  more robustly.

  ## Features


  - **Curated “Awesome” List**  
    - Listed as an “Awesome” project (follows the awesome-list format and quality bar).  
    - Focused specifically on false assumptions and pitfalls in software design.

  - **Domain-Focused Falsehood Collections**  
    While the full README contains the detailed sections, this list is described as covering domains such as:
    - Time and dates (time zones, leap years, calendars, etc.)
    - Personal names and identity
    - Geography and locations
    - Other real-world domains where simple assumptions break down

  - **Explanations and References**  
    - Each falsehood or group of falsehoods is paired with context, explanations, and/or external resources.  
    - Helps clarify why specific assumptions fail in production systems.

  - **Developer-Centric Documentation Resource**  
    - Intended for programmers and architects designing data models, validation rules, and business logic.  
    - Supports more resilient and inclusive system design by highlighting edge cases.

  - **Multi-language Documentation**  
    - Main README available in English (`readme.md`).  
    - Additional Chinese translation (`readme.zh.md`).

  - **Repository Structure**  
    - `assets/` for images (including the header image).  
    - `.github/` configuration for repository workflows/community aspects.  
    - `license` file defining reuse terms.  
    - Ancillary support files such as `.lycheeignore` for link checking.

  - **Open Source & Community Contributions**  
    - Hosted on GitHub as a public repository.  
    - Maintained through commits and pull requests from the community.

  ## Ideal Use Cases


  - As a checklist before designing schemas and validation rules for user
  data.  

  - As a teaching resource for software engineering, highlighting real-world
  complexity.  

  - As reference material when debugging production issues caused by
  oversimplified assumptions.
