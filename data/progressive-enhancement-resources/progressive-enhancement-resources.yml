  # Progressive Enhancement Resources


  A curated, "awesome-style" directory of articles, tools, books, and examples
  focused on progressive enhancement in web development.


  ## Overview


  - **Type:** Curated resource list / themed directory

  - **Focus:** Progressive enhancement concepts, strategies, feature detection,
  testing, and practical examples

  - **URL:**
  https://github.com/jbmoelker/progressive-enhancement-resources#readme

  - **Categories:** Themed directories, web development, accessibility,
  resources


  ## Features


  ### Topical Structure

  The collection is organized into clear sections:


  1. **The Concept**  
     Resources explaining what progressive enhancement is and why it matters:
     - Fundamentals of starting with content, then layering enhancements.
     - Ensuring access to content regardless of device or browser capability.
     - Criteria and rules for enriching the user interface.
     - Book-length deep dives into progressive enhancement principles.
     - Connections between progressive enhancement, adaptive web design, and progressive web apps.

  2. **Strategies**  
     Approaches for applying progressive enhancement:
     - **Content-out approach:** Designing from content outward to avoid technological restrictions.
     - **HTML-first baseline:** Making pages usable with only HTML as the baseline for all devices and browsers.
     - **Test-driven progressive enhancement:** Enhancing the experience only after verifying capabilities.
     - **“Cut the mustard” approach:** Setting a capability threshold before applying certain enhancements.
     - **Component-level grading:** Grading and enhancing components rather than entire browsers.
     - **Different detection strategies:** Comparing feature detection, browser detection, and form-factor detection.
     - **Server-side device detection:** Using server-side logic to adapt to different devices.

  3. **Feature Detection**  
     (Introduced in the overview and contents; details further down the list.)
     - Techniques for detecting HTML5 and other platform features.
     - Examples and demos showing practical feature detection.

  4. **Support Tables**  
     - Links (in the full list) to compatibility/support tables to understand feature availability across environments.

  5. **Testing Methods**  
     - Approaches and tools for validating progressive enhancement behavior.
     - Ensuring that enhancements do not break baseline functionality.

  6. **Examples**  
     - (Code) examples demonstrating progressive enhancement in real interfaces.
     - Step-by-step enhancements from basic content to richer interactions.

  7. **Related Articles**  
     - Additional reading around progressive web apps and broader enhancement practices.

  ### Content Types Included


  - **Articles & Blog Posts**
    - Conceptual explanations (e.g., “Progressive Enhancement: It’s about the content”).
    - UX and UI enhancement guidelines.
    - Strategy discussions (e.g., content-out, cut-the-mustard, component grading).

  - **Books**
    - "Designing with Progressive Enhancement" (400+ pages).
    - "Adaptive Web Design" (progressive enhancement from content through interaction).

  - **Technical Guides & Tutorials**
    - Feature detection (HTML5 and beyond) with examples and demos.
    - Device and environment detection strategies (client-side and server-side).

  - **Practical Examples**
    - Code and interface examples applying progressive enhancement patterns.

  ### Use Cases


  - Learning the fundamentals and theory of progressive enhancement.

  - Designing HTML-first, accessible user experiences.

  - Implementing feature detection and environment-aware enhancements.

  - Evaluating browser/device capabilities and planning fallbacks.

  - Finding example code and established patterns for progressive enhancement.


  ## Pricing


  - Not a paid product or service.  

  - Access to the GitHub repository and listed resources is free (subject to
  each linked resource’s own terms, if any).
