# UFL Sparse Matrix Collection

The UFL Sparse Matrix Collection is a long‑standing, curated repository of sparse matrices from real applications, widely used for benchmarking numerical algorithms and linear algebra software. It functions as a well‑structured directory of reusable numerical datasets, similar in role to an awesome-style collection but focused on sparse matrices.
