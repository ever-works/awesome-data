  ### Description

  Awesome Rust is a community-maintained, curated directory of Rust code and
  resources. It organizes notable Rust libraries, tools, and learning materials
  into a structured, searchable list hosted on GitHub.


  ### Features

  - **Curated Rust ecosystem directory**
    - Collects notable Rust libraries, frameworks, tools, and educational resources.
    - Focuses on quality and usefulness rather than being an exhaustive index.

  - **Community-maintained list**
    - Open to contributions via standard GitHub workflows (issues and pull requests).
    - Guidelines for contributors are documented (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

  - **Open, permissive licensing**
    - Distributed under the CC0-1.0 license, allowing reuse and remixing of the list contents.

  - **Organized repository structure**
    - Source content stored under a `src` directory.
    - Additional data and generated outputs under a `results` directory.
    - Project configuration files for formatting and linting (e.g., `.editorconfig`, `.markdownlint.json`).

  - **Ecosystem integration**
    - Hosted as a standard GitHub repository, enabling forking, starring, and reuse.
    - Long-running, actively updated list with thousands of commits.

  - **Developer tooling metadata**
    - Includes Rust project files (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`), indicating tooling support for building or generating parts of the list.

  ### Pricing

  - Free to access and use.

  - Content is available under the CC0-1.0 public domain dedication (no cost or
  licensing fees).
