## Overview
Meta Awesome – PHP Internals Reading is an Awesome-style **curated meta list** that aggregates reading lists and Awesome directories specifically focused on **PHP internals** and **PHP engine architecture**. It serves as a starting point for developers who want to dive deeper into how PHP works under the hood by collecting existing high‑quality resources in one place.

## Features
- **Meta directory of resources**
  - Organizes links to multiple reading lists and Awesome collections about PHP internals.
  - Acts as a hub rather than a standalone tutorial or book.

- **Focus on PHP internals and engine architecture**
  - Emphasizes materials about the PHP engine, Zend Engine, opcodes, memory management, and low‑level behavior.
  - Aimed at developers interested in understanding or contributing to the PHP core.

- **Curated reading lists**
  - Collects reading lists created by the community that explain internal components of PHP.
  - Prioritizes structured, educational content rather than random articles.

- **Awesome-style format**
  - Follows the common “Awesome list” convention for organization and readability.
  - Likely grouped by topics (e.g., intros to internals, engine design, extensions, debugging tools), making it easier to navigate.

- **Documentation-oriented**
  - Targets technical documentation, deep-dive articles, and reference materials.
  - Useful for study, research, or onboarding to PHP internals.

- **GitHub-hosted**
  - Maintained as a Markdown document in a public repository.
  - Can be forked, starred, and extended by the community.

## Typical Use Cases
- Finding starting points to learn **how PHP is implemented internally**.
- Collecting references before **contributing to PHP core or extensions**.
