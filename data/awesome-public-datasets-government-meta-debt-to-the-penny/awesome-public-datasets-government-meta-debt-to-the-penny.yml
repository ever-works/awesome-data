  ## Overview

  The **Debt to the Penny** dataset publishes official, daily data on the **total outstanding public debt of the United States**. It breaks down the national debt into:

  - **Debt Held by the Public** (marketable and non‑marketable securities held outside the federal government)
  - **Intragovernmental Holdings** (obligations the federal government owes to its own trust funds and certain government accounts)
  - **Total Public Debt Outstanding (TPDO)** (sum of the two components)

  Coverage begins **1993‑04‑01** and extends through **2025‑12‑26**, with data **released daily**. The dataset is **updated at the end of each business day** using values from the previous business day.

      - Government trust funds
      - Revolving funds
      - Special funds

      - Reconstructing the published report’s structure
      - Understanding hierarchies within the source table

  - **Update timing:** End of each business day (for the previous business day)

  ### Data structure

  - **Field-level metadata:**
    - Data type (e.g., `DATE`, `CURRENCY`, `INTEGER`)
    - Required/optional indicator

  ### Access & formats

  - **Web data portal** with search and dataset view
  - **API access** via an “API Quick Guide” (on the source site) for programmatic retrieval
  - **Reports and files** section (file list provided on source site when available)

  ### Notes & Known Limitations

  - **Definition of Total Public Debt Outstanding (TPDO):**
    - TPDO = Debt Held by the Public + Intragovernmental Holdings.
    - In this dataset, **Intragovernmental Holdings includes FFB securities**.

  - **Relationship to other Fiscal Data national debt datasets:**
    - **Debt to the Penny**
      - Contains TPDO plus a breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragovernmental Holdings.
      - Intragovernmental Holdings includes FFB securities.
    - **Historical Debt Outstanding**
      - Contains TPDO only, **no breakout** of Debt Held by the Public vs Intragovernmental Holdings.
      - TPDO includes FFB securities.
    - **Daily Treasury Statement (DTS)**
      - Contains Debt Held by the Public and Intragovernmental Holdings, but **does not aggregate** them into TPDO.
      - Intragovernmental Holdings includes FFB securities.

  These definitional nuances matter when comparing national debt figures across Treasury datasets.
