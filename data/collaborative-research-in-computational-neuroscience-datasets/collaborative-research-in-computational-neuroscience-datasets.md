## Overview

The CRCNS data sharing initiative provides a large, curated collection of experimental and computational neuroscience datasets. These include electrophysiology, imaging, behavioral, and simulation data organized by brain region, system, species, and methodological focus.

## Features

### 1. Brain Region–Specific Datasets
Datasets are grouped into folders by brain area or structure, allowing targeted access:
- **Visual cortex** – Data from visual cortical areas.
- **Auditory cortex** – Data related to auditory processing.
- **Inner ear/cochlea** – Peripheral auditory system datasets.
- **Frontal cortex** – Frontal cortical activity and related experiments.
- **Prefrontal cortex (PFC)** – Executive function and PFC recordings.
- **Parietal cortex** – Sensory integration and parietal activity.
- **Motor cortex** – Motor control and movement-related neural data.
- **Somatosensory cortex** – Touch and body-sensation related datasets.
- **Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)** – Reward, decision making, and OFC recordings.
- **Hippocampus** – Memory and navigation-related datasets.
- **Thalamus** – Thalamic relay and processing data.
- **Retina** – Early visual system recordings from the retina.
- **LGN (Lateral Geniculate Nucleus)** – Thalamo-visual pathway datasets.
- **Basal forebrain** – Modulatory and basal forebrain recordings.
- **Brainstem** – Brainstem circuits and responses.
- **Cerebellum** – Motor coordination and cerebellar datasets.

### 2. Species and Preparation–Specific Collections
- **Avian** – Bird nervous system datasets.
- **Insect** – Invertebrate insect nervous system data.
- **Aplysia** – Marine mollusk (Aplysia) neural datasets.
- **Tunicates** – Marine invertebrate (tunicate) datasets.

### 3. Behavioral and Systems-Level Data
- **Eye movements** – Neural and/or behavioral data related to oculomotor control.
- **Movements** – Data related to body movements, such as reaching and motor behavior.

### 4. Methodology- and Task-Focused Collections
- **Challenges** – Datasets specifically designed for prediction or modeling challenges (e.g., predicting neuron responses).
- **Methods** – Datasets notable for particular experimental or analytical methods.
- **Tools** – Software tools for data processing, accompanied by example datasets illustrating their use.
- **Simulations** – Computational and simulated neural data.

### 5. Data Types (from overall initiative description)
- Electrophysiology recordings.
- Imaging data.
- Behavioral measurements.
- Computational/simulation outputs.
