## Overview

Meta Awesome – REST Frameworks is a GitHub-hosted index that links out to multiple Awesome lists and curated resources about REST and HTTP-based API frameworks. It serves as a meta-directory: instead of listing individual libraries directly, it organizes existing curated lists so developers can quickly discover relevant REST frameworks, tools, and ecosystems across languages and platforms.
