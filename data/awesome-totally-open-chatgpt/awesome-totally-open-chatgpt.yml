  ## Description

  A community-maintained “awesome list” that catalogs fully open-source
  alternatives to ChatGPT. It focuses on conversational AI systems built from
  instruction‑tuned language models and excludes simple frontends that just call
  proprietary APIs.


  ## Scope & Criteria

  - Includes projects that:
    - Provide open conversational AI systems or chat interfaces.
    - Use language models finetuned for human instruction and chat.
  - Excludes projects that:
    - Are only alternative frontends to OpenAI’s APIs.
    - Use models not finetuned for instruction or chat.

  ## Tagging System

  Each listed project is annotated with one of the following tags:


  - **Bare**
    - Only source code.
    - No datasets, no model weights, no bundled chat system.

  - **Standard**
    - Includes training data.
    - Provides model weights.
    - Offers a basic chat capability (e.g., via API), but not a full-featured UI.

  - **Full**
    - Includes training data and model weights.
    - Provides a more complete chat experience, often with TUI/GUI or other “fancy” interfaces.

  - **Complicated**
    - Partially open or semi–open-source.
    - May depend on closed models or other non‑fully‑open components.

  ## Features

  - **Curated directory of open ChatGPT alternatives**
    - Aggregates projects that implement instruction‑tuned conversational models.
    - Functions as a specialized directory within the broader “awesome-lists” ecosystem.

  - **Clear inclusion/exclusion rules**
    - Disallows entries that are merely UIs for proprietary APIs.
    - Focuses on projects with genuine open conversational modeling.

  - **Project classification via tags**
    - Differentiates projects by openness and completeness (Bare, Standard, Full, Complicated).
    - Helps users quickly identify whether a project includes data, weights, and/or chat UI.

  - **Pointers to related resources**
    - Links to other relevant lists, such as:
      - `yaodongC/awesome-instruction-dataset` (open datasets for training instruction‑following LLMs like ChatGPT, LLaMA, Alpaca).

  - **Open licensing for the list itself**
    - The repository content is released under **CC0-1.0**, allowing broad reuse and redistribution of the list.

  ## Licensing

  - **Repository license:** CC0-1.0 (public domain dedication) for the list
  content.


  ## Pricing

  - Not applicable – this is a free, open-source curated list, not a commercial
  product or service.
