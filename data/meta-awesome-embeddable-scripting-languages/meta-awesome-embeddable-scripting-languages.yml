  ## Overview
  Meta Awesome – Embeddable Scripting Languages is an "awesome-style" curated index that aggregates multiple awesome lists focused on embeddable scripting languages. It serves as a centralized directory for resources, libraries, and projects related to embedding scripting languages into applications.

  ## Features
  - **Aggregated awesome lists**: Brings together several existing awesome lists specifically about embeddable scripting languages into a single index.
  - **Curated content**: Focuses on well-maintained and relevant lists, following the general "awesome" list conventions (community-driven, high-signal links).
  - **Topic specialization**: Narrowly centered on *embeddable* scripting languages (e.g., languages designed or commonly used to be embedded in host applications).
  - **Documentation-based directory**: Provided as a Markdown document in a GitHub repo, easy to browse, fork, and contribute to.
  - **Developer-oriented**: Aimed at developers looking for options to embed scripting engines in their software, including languages, bindings, and related tools.
  - **Meta-directory structure**: Acts as a directory of directories (meta list), pointing to other curated lists rather than individual projects only.
  - **Version-controlled on GitHub**: Benefits from Git-based history, issue tracking, and community pull requests.
